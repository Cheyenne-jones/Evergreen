    LP#1296937: move the $force_bc parameter of ->charged_items() to an implementation method
    
    Argubably, the $force_bc parameter of OpenILS::SIP::Patron->charged_items()
    method exists solely as an implementation convenience for the renew-all
    code.  Consequently, this patch removes the $force_bc parameter from the
    public interface for charged_items() and spins it off into a new
    implementation method.
    
    This patch should be applied at the same time that a reversion of
    SIPServer commit c97d64412bc is applied.  Note that a user who upgrades
    SIPServer without upgrading Evergreen to a version that contains this
    patch will end up in a situation where the code that counts active
    loans for the patron information response will fetch the loans using
    $force_bc set to true; this works only by coincidence.

    LP#1321429: Use server-local time as best-guess
    
    When first calculating the shelf expire time, we assume "now" as
    the starting point by calling DateTime->now().  However, that gives
    us the time in UTC.  That's not good because closed dates are stored
    timezone-aware.  Instead, ask for server-local time.

    LP#1312945: authority.calculate_authority_linking and multiple linked tags
    
    The function "authority.calculate_authority_linking" was not able to deal with
    situations where there are multiple marc tags that are linkable. The function
    only process the first tag that contains a linking_subfield and returns that
    to be inserted into the authority_linking table, even when there are more than
    one of the same tag with linking_subfield.
    
    Added an additional loop to loop through each tag, for situations where there are
    multiples of each tag.

    LP#1312945: auth-auth linking: cache less agressively and look for all links
    
    There was a logic inversion that was causing miss-use of a per-
    record cache mechanism.  I remove that entirely, as it's not helpful
    in practice.
    
    Also, after finding one use of a linked field we moved on to the
    next, though it is possible for more than one link to exist for
    different uses of a name, say.  Now we'll loop through all fields
    to find all possible linkages.
