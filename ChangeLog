    LP#1078593 Assorted small Serial.pm fixes
    
    1) fleshed_issuance_alter() changes
      - First, if one of the inner updates returns an event, abort early.
        Otherwise, we might overwrite the event while looping and lose
        the error.
      - Second, add authtoken to the created editor.  This editor gets
        passed around, and other functions might look for it there.
    
    2) pass $type down into _summarize_contents()
      - Right now, we have a bug where supplement/index contents in a
        merged MFHD record will get added to the basic contents (and
        vice-(vice-)versa).  By passing in $type, we can assure that
        we only return the type of contents we are looking for.
    
    3) _prepare_summaries() should acknowledge empty summaries
      - Under normal use, summaries will generally grow, and never shrink
        to nothing.  However, we must still handle cases where we have
        discarded/deleted our last issuance, and in those cases, make sure
        we "empty" the generated_coverage field in our summary.

    LP#1415572: ensure correct version of authority.normalize_heading() is in place
    
    Some upgraded Evergreen databases can have the wrong version
    of the authority.normalize_heading() function in place because
    of a mixup in the 0848 schema upgrade script.  The problem can
    manifest itself by there being rows in authority.record_entry
    where the heading and simple_heading columns have "NOHEADING"
    values regardless of the control set:
    
    -[ RECORD 1 ]--+---------------------------------------------
    heading | NOHEADING_a ff0ed9fcd13e8944d9a718650840787a
    simple_heading | NOHEADING_a ff0ed9fcd13e8944d9a718650840787a
    
    This patch ensures that the correct version is in place and
    updates authority.record_entry to fix up affected rows without
    requiring a full authority ingest.

    LP#1414112: avoid excluding record attribute values that contain only blanks
    
    Certain record attributes, chiefly the ones whose values comes
    from MARC fixed fields and which have a coded value map associated
    with them, can have a string consisting of one or more blanks as a
    valid value.  Consequently, this patch ensures that
    reingest_record_attributes() no longer excludes all attributes that
    have blank values from the final attribute list.
    
    This fixes a problem where MARC records with the target audience (008/22)
    coded as a blank (unknown or not specified) could no longer be retrieved
    using an "audience( )" search filter.
    
    After applying this patch, a reingest of record attributes should be
    performed, e.g., by doing
    
      select metabib.reingest_record_attributes(id)
      from biblio.record_entry
      where not deleted;

    LP#1415898 Fix Potential Cstore Starvation in the OPAC
    
    When a user views their current circulations and/or renews them via
    the OPAC, a connection is made to a cstore drone so that the user's
    circulations can be retrieved from the database, bypassing the cache.
    This connection is not closed, and thus a cstore drone is left unable
    to respond to new requests for several seconds.  On a busy server,
    this has actually caused the number of cstore drones to hit the limit
    configured in opensrf.xml.  If that situation continues for too long,
    it leads to the load on the server spiking to the point where services
    must be restarted.
    
    This commit changes from xact_rollback to rollback so that the connection
    will be closed.

    The getit_results function in EGKPacLoader.pm does xact_begin, which
    opens a connected session to a cstore drone.  It later does xact_rollback,
    which does not disconnect the session.  This leaves a drone hanging for
    several seconds unable to responde to new requests.  This commit switches
    to a rollback call that does disconnect the session.

    LP#1396161: action_trigger_runner.pl documentation update
    
     - Removed --granularity-only help docs.  Ever since the script was changed to
       support parallel execution of different granularity levels the granularity-only
       setting has always been set when using --granularity.
    
     - Added --verbose help docs.  This option wasn't included in the help docs.
    
     - Clarification - added some clarification to a few of the help descriptions.
    
     - Added an additional example for processing hooks and running pending events
       with a granularity set.
    
     - Removed two references to the --granularity-only flag in the Telephony docs.
    
    I believe this change is valid for 2.7, 2.6 and 2.5 since the change to the script
     was made in 2010.

    repairs it dynamically, but might as well be correct.

    LP#1373594: Also ignore subfield 7 in get_graphics_880s
    
    In the Czech Republic the subfield 7 of MARC fields 1XX and 7XX are used for
    the National authority control number.
    
    The problem is, that in current Evergreen versions, the subfield 7 is displayed
    as a part of the link to author seach in search result or record details, but
    when using the linkt to search rcords of the same author, no results are
    returned, no matter whether the records exist or not.
    
    That is why we nedd to add the subfield 7 into get_graphic_880s.

    to make left joining rcil and legacy stat cat sources the default behavior.

    LP#1310619: Add links in reporter.classic_item_list to legacy_cat1 and legacy_cat2 views.
    
    Currently, the reporter.classic_item_list view has the Legacy Cat 1 and 2
    fields defined as "text", not "link", so all it will report out is the ID
    number of the stat cat.  We want nullability control over stat cat entries,
    so these need to be "link".

    LP#1408803 Add 'persist' login type to auth_proxy sample config
    
    A recent version of EG added the option to "stay logged in", and this
    was implemented as a new login type. Since basically everyone will use
    this option via the OPAC, it makes sense that this should be part of the
    sample config for auth_proxy.
