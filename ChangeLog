    Docs: Fix filenames to match references in the docs
    
    These image files were not displaying in the docs because the filenames
    and the references used different capitalization. Web URLs are
    case-sensitive, so this commit changes the image filenames to be all
    lowercase.

    LP1084269, LP1050043 Expert Search Fixes
    
    Sorting Expert Search corrected
    
    LP1050043 was issued because attempting to sort the MARC expert search
    results, in the staff client, caused the staff client to return to the
    basic search page rather than sort the results.
    
    To fix the sorting I had to modify two perl files.
    
    metabib.pm had to be changed in a number of ways.
    
    1. The way the sort works currently assumes the user is doing a full
    text search.  So, it passes in the values of titlesort and authorsort as
    the sort variable in the URL.  However, in the expert search, it is
    looking for the values 'title' and 'author'.  This resulted in the title
    sort and author sort never being executed and returning the relevance
    sort instead. I modified the search to use a regex instead of eq.
    
    2. If a record has no value associated with it e.g. no 260 c for
    pubdate, no 245 $a for title, no 1xx $a for author, then the SQL is
    supposed to replace those values with either 'AAAA' or 'zzzz' depending
    on the order of the sort.  This should cause records without the
    relevant sort values to be pushed to the bottom of the sort results.
    
    But, the PgSQL function COALESCE, which is supposed to do the
    replacing, does not do anything if no rows are returned for a record's
    relevant value.  To work around this, I surrounded the relevant values
    with the MAX() function call, which returns NULL if no row is returned.
    
    Because author sort works on any 1xx value, it sorts those values in
    numerical order when there is more than one 1xx in a record.  This
    requires the use of an ORDER BY statement, which seems to nullify
    the effect of MAX().  So, I had to move the MAX() into a second SELECT
    statement in the case of author sort.
    
    3. I added the variables number_default_sort and string_default_sort
    to the metabib code because the current code hard codes values of
    '9999' and 'zzzzzzzz' into the sort.
    
    Search.pm had to be changed to pass the sort values from the TPAC
    into the relevant sort subroutines.  This was done with the addition of
    an $arghash variable that checks the cgi parameters for the sort
    variable.
    
    As well, Expert search puts the tag and _special params in the
    search form.  This causes all other searches to perform Expert searches
    afterwords.  To fix this, Search.pm is modified to look for an empty
    query value before it conducts an Expert search.  If it is empty and
    the Expert search variables are present, then the Expert search is
    performed.  Otherwise, a normal search is done.
    
    Finally, to fix the problem reported by LP1050043, I had to modify
    searchbar.tt2.  Currently, searchbar.tt2 does not have the values from
    the Expert search entered into the <form> where the sort functionality
    is located.  This means, when a sort option is chosen, the TPAC no
    longer knows which values were used for the Expert search.
    
    This is not obvious at first because after choosing to sort, the
    user is returned to a page where the URL has the Expert search values
    in it.  This happens because the sort is submitting a form without a
    query value, so the TPAC redirects the user to the referring page,
    which is the initial Expert search.
    
    To fix this, I added the Expert search values as hidden variables
    into the <form> where the sort functionality is located.  I also
    removed the use of the "_adv" hidden variable from the <form> when
    not in the advanced search.
    
    [LP1094269] Retrive past 100 records in Expert Search
    
    Currently, when paging through the results of the Expert search, the
    system will not return more than 100 records.  Going past page 10
    causes a no results screen.
    
    This is due to the offset and limit values not being passed into the
    argument hash used to create the SQL for the search.  Once the SQL
    returns, it returns record ids within the range of the offset and
    the limit. So, if the offset is 100 and the limit is 10, the record
    ids for search results 100 to 109 are returned.
    
    But, because offset and limit are not being passed into the arghash,
    they default to 0 and 100 respectively.  This means the first 100
    records are always returned regardless of where in the search pages
    you are viewing.  These 100 results were then pruned to the relevant
    10 results in Biblio.pm.  However, if the offset starts beyond 100
    then no results are returned because the results passed 100 are not
    returned by metabib.pm.
    
    This commit passes the offset and limit as arguments in the search
    hash.  It also removes offset and limit as parameters of the
    search.biblio.marc call. Because offset and limit are needed in the
    arghash to limit the number of records returned, it is better to
    pass them only via the arghash to ensure that no more than the
    necessary number of records are returned.
    
    Offset and limit could be kept as parameters, but it would require
    modifying metabib as well to look for those parameters, so I think
    forcing the Expert search to pass them as argument parameters is the
    better option.
    
    As well, this commit removes the pruning in Biblio.pm that was based
    on the offset and limit because that is handled in metabib.pm now
    that offset and limit are being supplied in the argument hash.
    
    I have checked the source code and the marc_search function in
    Biblio.pm is only called via the Expert search in
    WWW/EGCatLoader/Search.pm, so modifying Biblio.pm in this manner
    will only affect the Expert search and nothing else.

    I abstracted the logic out of 'sort_value' and 'render' in the 'call_number' column in the 'columns' group and from
    'render' in the 'call_number' column in the 'hold_columns' group to a utility function  called
    'sort_call_numbers_by_label_sortkey'.

    Docs: various AsciiDoc formatting fixes for docs
    
    Fixed the 'bad first character' error, the bad apostrophe error. Removed various UTF-8 chars.
    Fixed some numbered list formatting, to take out redundant manual numerals…
    
    for example:
    
    . 1 item
    . 2 item
    . 3 item
    
    became:
    
    . item
    . item
    . item
    
    also added "+" to wrap around breaks in numbered lists
    
    for example:
    
    . Right-click on the value control for the fixed field that needs to be edited.
    
     image::media/ffrc1.jpg[]
    
     . Select the appropriate value for the fixed field from the menu options.

    When getting ISBNs from the database, they often contain extra stuff
    after the ISBN that sometimes causes problems for Business::ISBN.
    
    This commit attempts to resolve some of that by looking only for the
    part of the ISBN data that resembles an ISBN and using just that part.
    If the ISBN data doesn't look like an ISBN, then it is discarded.

    LP#1348731: Optional Auth login nonce to differentiate same-username logins
    
    If multiple login attempts are made using the same username within a
    very short period of time, a race condition exists where, upon
    completion of the first login, the auth init cache data for any pending
    logins are removed, since there can only be one instance of cached init
    data per username.
    
    This adds support for allowing the caller to pass in a random string
    which is added to the cache key as a way to differentiate between logins
    using the same username.
    
    The seed is passed into auth init as an optional secondary parameter
    and passed again (via the "nonce" argument) to auth complete to ensure
    consistent cache keys across both interactions.
    
    Example:
    
    my $nonce = rand($$);
    
    my $seed = request(
        'open-ils.auth',
        'open-ils.auth.authenticate.init', $username, $nonce );
    
    my $response = request(
        'open-ils.auth',
        'open-ils.auth.authenticate.complete',
        {
            username => $username,
            password => md5_hex($seed . md5_hex($password)),
            type     => 'opac',
            nonce    => $nonce
        }
    );
    
    The race condition has been observed with the SIP2 gateway when
    multiple devices have been configured to use the same account.

    Documentation: Upgrade instructions examples
    
    This commit adds a note (with examples) about upgrading the database schema
    across major versions. It also reformats a long line into multiple lines,
    changes a NOTE to a TIP, makes a small correction, and replaces a repetitive
    command with a short explanation.
