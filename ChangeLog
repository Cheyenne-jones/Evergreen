    LP#1562153: fix case where changing sort order to relevance can fail
    
    This patch fixes a cause where sending a 'sort' CGI parameter
    with the empty string as value (which specifies relevance sorting)
    fails to override a previously-set sort order.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Do a public catalog search starting from the advanced search form,
        e.g., keyword = "cats"
    [2] Change the sort order to (say) Title A-Z from the results page.
    [3] Note that the query string changes to "sort(titlesort) cats" and
        that the results are re-sorted
    [4] Attempt to change the sort order to relevance.
    [5] This time, the sort order does not change ... and it should have.
    [6] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-5. This time, the sort order
        should be successfully changed.

    LP#1559121: remove Debian Squeeze support
    
    Now that Debian Squeeze's LTS (long-term support) period
    has ended, Evergreen no longer offers community support
    for that distribution. This patch removes references
    to Squeeze from the installation scripts and documentation.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Verify that Debian Squeeze is no longer referenced in
        the installation documentation.

    LP#1373601: Consider relevant characters before using word-boundary checks
    
    To perform unanchored phrase limits, we make sure that the phrase supplied
    by the user does not end in the middle of a word by bounding the condition
    with word-boundary bracket expresssions.  However, if the phrase starts
    or ends with a non-word character (that is, something other than numbers,
    letters, or the underscore) then the word-boundary expression won't match.
    The effect of this is to cause phrase searches starting or ending in
    punctuation to fail when the user would not expect them to.
    
    To address this, we now test the phrase for word-iness at the front and
    back before applying word-boundary bracket expressions.
