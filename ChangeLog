	  after the initial transaction has been committed

	* Normalize ISBNs by stripping hyphens in search methods and in
	  reporter.materialized_simple_record
	  
	  We weren't normalizing ISBNs in search or in
	  reporter.materialized_simple_record
	  which required users to exactly match the form of the ISBN as
	  entered in the
	  MARC record to get a successful search result - pretty hit or
	  miss.
	  
	  The longer term fix in 2.0 and above is to make the ISBN search
	  search against
	  the identifier|isbn index, which also gets ISBN10/ISBN13
	  equivalence goodness.
	  But this patch will be relatively easy to backport through to
	  1.6.1 and plugs
	  some of the holes in our exposed APIs and search points in the
	  short term.

	  Booking: fix the targeter in the
	  I'm-reserving-this-exact-resource-with-this-
	  exact-barcode case.
	  
	  It should have always worked like this. This should better mirror
	  the behavior
	  in the holds targeter when placing a copy-level hold. Basically
	  don't fail
	  to target a resource for a reservation later just because it's
	  not in an
	  available status right at this moment.

	* Correct the install location for Dojo i18n bundles
	  
	  We had been converting xx-YY into xx/yy for a directory
	  structure,
	  but current evidence shows that it should be xx-yy. Hard to
	  believe
	  we've overlooked this for so long. Also, with the exception of
	  the
	  en-ca/en-gb/en-us locales, we should probably trim the locale to
	  just xx - but that's a different problem, and let's just focus on
	  getting this working to begin with.

	* Fix cloning of AutoField widgets: LP #728055
	  
	  Cloning Action/Trigger event definitions was not working
	  properly, as
	  all values were being copied from the original object using their
	  display
	  strings rather than the underlying values.
	  
	  Bill Erickson suggested a fix in IRC that works, so full credit
	  to him
	  for this change!

	* Draw pre-cataloged items (author and title) in My Account
	  checkedout screen
	  
	  Two problems: FETCH_MODS_FROM_COPY returns an object, so we
	  weren't
	  getting to the point of fetching the raw copy itself, and there
	  was
	  some confusion about pre-cataloged vs. non-cataloged items that
	  is
	  hopefully straightened out now.

	  These duplicate perms somehow slipped into r18962 and need to
