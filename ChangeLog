    LP#1786987: Locale-less org tree cache object becomes stale
    
    The autogen.sh script calls a function that flushes all org tree objects
    cached by locale, but does not flush the one used when the locale is
    unkown.  This commit forces that flushing to occur.

    LP#1794176 Avoid capturing grid cell tooltip/display values
    
    Remove the grid-tooltip logic that captured the cell content into a
    template-level variable so the content only needed to be generated once
    for both the tooltip and cell display.  This logic fails to handle cases
    where the cell content is dynamic, typically the result of row
    attributes being modified via external process.

    LP#1791340 Webstaff: Don't backdate when we're not
    
    There was code in the webstaff checkin interface which attempted to
    remove the backdate parameter when it wasn't needed, as its mere
    presence has a negative effect on the checkin process.  This fail-safe
    was not working, however.
    
    Instead, let's build on the same check function used for the display,
    so we can be more sure that if the user doesn't see that they are
    backdating, the interface will not treat it as a backdate, and
    vice-versa.

    LP#1745427: account for change in prediction patterns
    
    This patch fixes a bug in the web staff client where changing
    the active prediction pattern for a subscription would not
    reset the base issue when predicting the next run of issues.
    
    To test
    -------
    1. Set up a subscription in the web staff client with a prediction
       pattern (e.g., monthly).  Predict some issues.
    2. Create/select a new prediction pattern for a new publishing schedule,
       e.g., quarterly.
    3. Activate the new pattern and deactivate the old pattern.
    4. Click Predict New Issues.
    5. Enter in the new publication date/enumerations/chronology as needed.
    6. Enter a prediction count and select Save. Note that new issues
       appear to be based on the previous pattern.
    7. Apply the patch, delete the issues created in step 6, then repeat
       steps 4-6.  This time, new issues should be created using the new
       prediction pattern.

    LP#1781480: Closures remeber values in subtle ways...
    
    ... and we must take care to avoid that.  This commit forces a state variable
    to be statically assigned an empty list rather than depending on the idiomatic
    undef to vivicate an empty list.  This is important for all OpenSRF methods,
    and manifests here as a search "remembering" a previously chosen location
    group.  A comment to that point is included for our future selves.
    
    The core probably arises from the fact that, in the end, OpenSRF methods are
    generated closures.

    LP#1642344: XUL report cloning
    
    This patch allows report templates of version 4 and earlier
    (which would have been created by the XUL staff client) to
    be upgraded to template version 5 (used by the web staff
    client) when the user clones a report. This closes a limitation
    introduced in the reporter module for the web staff client.
    
    Note that during the conversion, inner joins are used by
    default when IDL classes have a 'has_a' relation rather than
    defaulting to left outer joins, improving correctness of the
    generated SQL query.
    
    To test
    -------
    [0] Apply the patch.
    [1] In a test database that has reporter templates created
        by (or for) the XUL staff client, create clones of
        those templates.
    [2] Verify that the output of reports created using the new
        templates matches output of reports from the original
        templates.

    lp1739286 default search box in Z39.50
    
    This change tweaks the layout of search fields in the web client Z39.50
    interface and adds radio buttons for the default search field to auto-focus.
    The behavior is "sticky" without the need for an explicit Save action.  If the
    current default field is not present due to a given combination of selected
    services, then no field will be focused by default.

    Adds the transit cancel time to the Most Recent Transits section of
    the Item Status Holds / Transit tab.
    
    Test plan:
    Place an item in transit and then cancel the transit. Retrieve the item in
    Item Status / Detail View. In the Holds / Transit tab, there is no indication
    the transit has been canceled before loading the patch. Post-patch, the
    cancel time will display.

    LP 1786534: Don't merge a user with itself.
    
    It's possible to merge a user with itself using the actor.usr_merge
    database function.  This does not produce a useful result.  One ends
    up with a user that is flagged deleted, has a null card field, and is
    likely to have their addresses and other cards deleted from the
    database.
    
    A simple check at the top of the database function to bail if the
    src_usr and dest_usr are the same prevents this from happening.  That
    is the change that this commit makes.

    LP#1781235: fix changing primary user barcode in web client
    
    This patch fixes a bug where the patron card dialog would
    not allow the user to change the primary barcode under certain
    circumstances. The fix is to ensure that the radio buttons
    controlling the selection of the primary card are bound to
    exactly one scope variable; otherwise, the /last/ barcode in the
    list that had a primary value set after user interaction would
    be the winner.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Use the 'replace barcode' feature in the patron editor to
        create a test patron with 3 barcodes:
    
        - barcode A
        - barcode B
        - barcode C (which as last created, would be primary)
    
    [2] Attempt to make barcode A the primary barcode again using
        the 'See All' patron card dialog in the patron editor.
    [3] Note that the change of primary barcode doesn't stick
        upon saving the patron record.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-3. This time, the
        primary barcode should be changed as expected.
    [5] Verify that other patron edit actions and registering a
        new patron record continue to work as expected.

    lp978095 auto-canceling lineitems
    
    "Acq: lineitems display as "on order" even after all copies have been cancelled"
    
    When a copy (lineitem detail) on a lineitem is canceled through the UI, all of
    the sibling copies are examined, and if they also happen to be canceled, then a
    cancel attempt is made on the parent lineitem.
    
    The cancel reason fed to the lineitem cancelation attempt will be the last
    cancel reason on an examined sibling lineitem where Keep Debits is True, or
    failing that, the cancel reason used wih the copy just canceled.
    
    The UI will refresh to the lineitem view when such an auto-cancelation happens.
