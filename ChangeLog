    LP#1623541: Booking will fail if its router isn't called "router"
    
    The circ code checks to see if the booking app is running, and if not, it
    skips some booking-related logic. This is a useful performance enhancement
    where booking is not in use. It does this by asking the OpenSRF router if
    the "open-ils.booking" app has registered with it. Most of the time the
    OpenSRF router will be called, unimaginatively, "router" but when it's not,
    booking will not be considered by the circ module even if it's running.
    
    Instead of assuming "router" we should simply look up the router's name.

    LP#1624846 Add charset declaration to TPAC print output
    
    Non-ASCII characters were printed incorrectly in some browsers, such as
    Firefox, that still default to ISO-8859-1 encodings in the absence of a
    specifically declared encoding.
    
    Our output encoding will always be UTF-8, so declare it.
