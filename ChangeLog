	* backporting 16376: fixed bug where updating the email address
	  resulted in updating the username instead of the email address on
	  the local copy of the user object in the opac. this bug likely
	  affected nothing.

	* Patch from James Fournie of SITKA:
	  
	  There was some discussion about problems with holds fulfillment
	  at the holds roundtable at EG2010. I am pleased to share this patch with
	  the community which has been thoroughly tested by the folks at
	  Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library. (thanks guys!)
	  
	  Background:
	  
	  Evergreen's default out-of-the-box behaviour for holds fulfillment is
	  a gas-saving method. Holds are fulfilled by proximity. In a
	  multibranch library, holds are fulfilled at the local branch first.
	  Many libraries, particularly single branch libraries may be ok with
	  this, but it may be problematic for other libraries.
	  
	  Imagine a scenario where you have a large central branch and a small
	  rural branch of the same library system. At the large branch, there
	  are many copies of Popular New DVD with lots of holds. There are no
	  copies at the rural branch. Patrons at the small rural branch who
	  want to pick up Popular New DVD at their home branch may never get
	  their hold fulfilled because the copies will stay at the large branch
	  as long as there are holds for pickup there.
	  
	  This patch adds an org unit setting that changes the opportunistic
	  check-in so that items checked in will be assigned to holds by request
	  date first, rather than proximity. This setting can be applied to
	  any level of the org tree, so in some situations you may even want to
	  activate FIFO for large libraries, but leave the original setting for
	  smaller libraries with less traffic who want to keep their copies more
	  local.
	  
	  Also credit to Jeff Godin who thought of the same patch and
	  contributed the setting name "holds FIFO" for the setting
	  
	  [ NOTE: Implications of mixed FIFO and non-FIFO environments that are
	  not sufficiently segregated by the use of Hard Boundaries for Holds
	  present a potenial for user confusion. Beware that mixing FIFO and
	  non-FIFO settings within a resource-sharing group will likely result in
	  severe imbalance of hold fulfillment, though further configuration,
	  development, tuning and testing may be able to mitigate these issues.
