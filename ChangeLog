    LP#1488655: fix MR remapping upon fingerprint change
    
    This patch ensures that if the fingerprint of a bib changes, the
    bib will be moved to a new metarecord as opposed to ending up
    as a member of more than one metarecord.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Note the metarecord that a bib belongs to.
    [2] Change the bib so that its fingerprint changes -- with stock
        cbf settings, editing the 245$a should suffice.
    [3] Note that it is now a component of two metarecords.
    [4] Apply the patch.
    [5] Repeat step 2 or force a reingest. The bib should now be part
        of exactly one metarecord.

    This patch contains pgTAP tests for verifying that when
    the fingerprint of a bib is changed, it remains part of

    its old and new MRs).

    LP#1584807: Clicking column header should not unsort list
    
    Clicking column headers in My Account cycled through ascending order,
    descending order, and then unsorted. But unsorting a list after clicking a
    header is unintutive to the user. Instead, it should toggle between ascending /
    descending order.
    
    Test plan
    * Using the concerto dataset, log in as user 99999395984 / maes1234
    * Go to the Items Out area of my account and click the title column header to
    sort the list.
    * The list will first sort alphabetically in ascending order, on a second click
    will sort alphabetically in descending order, and, on a third click, will
    return to the default sort order.
    * After loading the patch, clicking the column header should only result in
    sorting in ascending and descending order.

    LP#1282751 Credit card payment balance owed rounding fix
    
    Avoid using Perl's int() when summing owed/paid totals for display in
    the TPAC credit card payment form, since this can lead to rounding
    errors.
    
    A simple example of why we should not use int() when summing floating
    point numbers:
    
    perl -e 'print "no match\n" unless ((8.29 * 100) == int(8.29 * 100))';
    
    Furthermore, use the relatively new fpsum() utility function for summing
    floating point numbers so we can avoid having multiple versions of the
    summing logic floating (*cough*) around (*cough cough*).

    We had only documented the Apache 2.2 stanzas for mpm_prefork, so include a

    the memory leaks that we have seen, suggest lower settings for these two values
    (assuming that most sites will be serving a public catalogue instead of using a
    separate discovery layer).
    
    Also fix the weird formatting where Debian instructions were indented under a

    Also use dots for ordered bullets instead of renumbering all of the bullets

    LP#1623955: Keep periods in subject links
    
    The subject links in the record summary were stripping periods, changing
    headings that contained N.Y., for example, to NY in the subsequent search
    string. Since normalization at index time replaces the period with a space,
    clicking the subject links did not successfully retrieve all relevant
    results.
    
    Test plan:
    Click the Subject link for a record that has New York (N.Y.) in its heading and
    has no other instances of ny in the keyword index. This record will not be
    retrieved when you click the link. After loading the patch, the record will be
    successfully retrieved, along with other records that contain New York (N.Y.) in
    their subject headings.
