    LP#1664715: Hold ratio template ignores some copies
    
    The relatively new report template "Hold/Copy Ratio per Bib and Pickup Library
    (and Descendants)" only includes copies that are at locations that are
    actually pickup libraries of holds. For instance, if you have two branches (A
    and B) in a system, each with 10 copies attached to a bib, but a hold only at
    branch A, the ratio calculated at the system level sees 10 copies rather than
    twenty. This has the effect of inflating the hold side of the hold/copy ratio.
    
    The SQL definition is adjusted here to count copies across the entire branch
    of the org tree per bib, rather than through a join that restricts to those
    branches that are pickup libraries for a relevant hold.
    
    Upgrade note: Report templates using the Hold/Copy Ratio at Pickup Library
    and Descendants data source will need to be re-created to benefit from this
    bug fix.

    LP#1689656: Adjust to zero on negative balance
    
    Adjust to zero was not actually adjusting to zero on negative balances
    in at least some cases.  This patch corrects that behavior.
    
    Test plan:
    
    [1] Generate multiple overdue billings on an overdue circ.
    [2] Apply a payment (cash or forgive) to resolve the overdue billings.
    [3] Checkin the item using backdated checkin or amnesty mode, such that
        the overdue billings are automatically voided, resulting in a
        negative balance.
    [4] Adjust to zero.  A single new manual adjustment billing is created,
        reinstating one overdue billing, and then the adjust-to-zero process
        exits.  The negative balance has been reduced by the amount of one
        overdue billing, rather than being fully adjusted to zero.
    [5] Apply the patch and restart services.
    [6] Repeat steps 1-3 with a new circulation.
    [7] Adjust to zero.  This time, the balance should be correctly adjusted
        to zero, instead of exiting prematurely with an outstanding
        negative balance.

    LP#1486451: Remove rdetails_status nowrap style
    
    The copy details table was styled to not wrap, which sometimes pushed table
    contents off the page, particularly when some of the copies are conjoined
    items. This commit removes the style that was preventing wrapping.
    
    Test plan:
    Load record 15 in the Concerto dataset. Before the patch is loaded, you'll
    see that some of the content in the copy details table is pushed off the
    screen and requires horizontal scrolling. Post-patch, all of the copy
    details will display on screen without horizontal scrolling. In addition
    to the change in the Conjoined Items, you also might see some text wrapping
    in the Shelving Location and Status columns.

    Fix Can't locate object method "workstation" error
    
    When trying to utilize the Recall functionality, Evergreen would fail to update
    targeted circulations (truncate the due date, etc.)  In the logs, we would have
    an error like this:
    
    [] open-ils.storage [ERR ::action.pm:1597:] Processing of hold failed:
    Can't locate object method "workstation" via package "action::circulation" at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.14.2/OpenILS/Application/Storage/CDBI.pm line 181.
    
    We first tried adding the workstation column to Storage/CDBI/action.pm, but a
    similar message would then appear instead: Can't locate object method
    "checkin_workstation"
    
    This sidesteps the problem entirely.
    
    Thanks to Mike for the solution!

    LP#1205190: TPAC: Improve style.css to reduce warnings
    
    * Improve specificity: use background-image (for gradients) or
      background-color (for color) instead of just background, because we
      are only specifying the image or color, and not the rest of the
      background properties.
    * Declare the background-color first, followed by the background-images;
      these will only override if recognized by the browser.
    * Declare the standard (unprefixed) CSS linear-gradient last to prevent
      prefixed browser quirk versions from overriding the standardized form.
    * Remove the -moz- prefix from -moz-border-radius as that has not been
      supported by Gecko since Firefox 13.0; just plain border-radius now.
    * Fix bad selector ##rdetail_extras_expand (only one #, please).
