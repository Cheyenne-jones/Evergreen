    LP#968514: Revive bib/auth importing docs from 2.1, add intro
    
    This commit revives the following sections from the 2.1 version of the docs
    and updates them for 2.6:
    
      - marc_export: Exporting Bibliographic Records into MARC files
        - includes new options for 2.6
      - Importing Authority Records from Command Line
      - Importing Authority Records from the Staff Client
    
    The first two are included in a new section called "Support Scripts"
    within the "Developer Resources" section, with a new intro and summary
    of other commonly used scripts provided with Evergreen. The third section
    is moved inside the Cataloging chapter "Batch Importing MARC Records",
    with slight modifications to the intro to that chapter.

    LP#1326149 Use a TPAC-settable TIME_FORMAT for local time formats
    
    We had tried to use the format.time library setting, but that is meant
    for Dojo which uses the Unicode formats, that are incompatible with
    the POSIX strftime() formats required by Template::Plugin::Date.
    
    At the same time, we need to expose the raw machine-readable time
    for schema.org consumers, so express that in a @content attribute.
    
    And we might as well use a more meaningful <time> element instead of
    the meaningless <span>, just for good measure.

    LP#1301599 TPAC advanced search from labels
    
    Instead of using titles / aria-labels directly on advanced search
    selectors, provide selector IDs so the existing text labels can be
    turned into <labels> and linked (by id) to their form control.
    
    This means we only need one label per form control, which improves
    usability from an accessibility perspective.

    Previous to this commit, once we have determined that there are no
    local Located URIs or foreign copies, we include the record in the
    result set in the staff client.  However, the desire of library staff
    is that foreign Located URIs be valid as a visibility limiter.  So
    we now recheck at the end for that situation.  This honors the new
    "Located URIs act like copies" global flag.

    LP#1326983: excluded fulfilled holds when adding hold_request.shelf_expires_soon events
    
    This patch adjusts the example A/T filter for the
    hold_request.shelf_expires_soon hook to exclude hold requests that are
    already marked as fulfilled.  This saves time creating events that
    would immediately be marked as invalid per the HoldIsAvailable
    validator.
    
    It also addresses an issue for large databases that have lots of
    fulfilled holds wherein hold_request.shelf_expires_soon events can
    fail to be added at all due to a cstore timeout.
