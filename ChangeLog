    LP#1205492: fix crash when attempting to renew deposit & rental loans in OPAC
    
    This patch fixes a bug where attempting to renew a loan on an item
    that requires a deposit or a rental fee can cause an Apache
    internal server error.
    
    In particular, this patch supplies descriptions for the following
    events:
    
      ITEM_DEPOSIT_REQUIRED
      ITEM_RENTAL_FEE_REQUIRED
      ITEM_DEPOSIT_PAID
    
    It also normalizes how 'fail_part' is set in the renewal response,
    as the payload of an event returned when a renewal fails can
    be either a hash or an acp Fieldmapper object depending on the
    type of event.  In the former case, attempting to access an
    nonexistent ->fail_part method is what causes the crash.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create an item that requires a deposit or a rental fee
        and check it out.
    [2] Attempt to renew the loan in the public catalog. Note
        that an internal server error is returned.
    [3] Apply the patch and attept step 2 again. This time, the
        public catalog should display a notification to the patron
        that the renewal cannot take place, rather than crashing.
    [4] Set up other situations where a renewal should fail for
        reasons other than a deposit/rental fee being required. Verify
        that appropriate error messages are displayed in the public
        catalog.

    LP#1614807: Make holds history more responsive
    
    When retrieving the holds history page on a mobile device, re-orient the table
    as we do with other My Account screens.
    
    Test plan
    Pre-patch, retrieve the holds history screen for a patron that has enabled
    holds history. Resize the screen to a width of 600 pixels or smaller. No
    adjustments will be made to the table, and horizontal scrolling is required to
    see some data.
    
    Post-patch, after resizing this screen, the table should reorient itself with
    the headers displaying in the left column, as is done on the other My Account
    screens.

    LP#1614807: Fix spacing issues in responsive design for My Account screens
    
    This commit fixes the following spacing issues that are found in the My Account
    screens when loaded on a small-screen device:
    
    * When a field has no value, the text in the table header, which displays along
     the left, is cut off at the bottom. The Notes field on the Holds page is one
    place where this issue is commonly seen. With the fix, the headers are slightly
    out of alignment with the field data, but this is still an improvement over
    cutting off text on the screen.
    
    * If the only title(s) listed on the screen are short, requiring little width
    in a table cell, the text in the table header runs into field data. A good
    example in the Concerto data is if the user only has a check out for record ID
    2 (Le concerto) on their account.
    
    * The checkboxes in the Check Out History and Items on Hold screen were pushed
    to the right. We fix it by giving the cells with a checkbox a "checkbox_column"
    class, which was already in use by the checkbox on the Items Out screen.

    LP#1614807: Holds history should look like other My Account screens
    
    The Holds History My Account interface looks entirely different than the Items
    Out, Check Out History, and Items On Holds interfaces. This commit adds a new
    acct_holds_hist_header CSS class that shares the same styles as the CSS classes
    used for the other three interfaces. Inline styles are removed from this table.
    
    Test plan
    Pre-patch: Go to the My Account Items Out, Check Out History, Items on Hold,
    and Holds History interfaces. While the first three interfaces use a table with
    a white background for the headers and a gray background for the body, the Holds
    History interface is the opposite.
    
    Post patch: All four interfaces should show a similar style to each other.

    LP#1614807: Fix Circ History table header display on small screens
    
    Because the table in circs.tt2 and circ_history.tt2 shared the same CSS class,
    circ_history.tt2 was displaying circs.tt2's column headers on mobile devices
    and other small screens. The two tables now have distinct classes, and
    styles.css.tt2 has been updated to provide the correct table headers for the
    circ history page.
    
    Test plan
    Pre-patch, pull up a user account that has a circ history in My Account, go to
    the Check Out History tab, then resize the screen to a width of 600 pixels or
    smaller. The table headers will now display along the side, but the headers
    will be the ones that typically display in the Items Out screen. The Barcode
    will display in the Date Returned row and the Call number will display in the
    Barcode row.
    
    Post-patch, after resizing the screen, the headers that display along the side
    should match the ones from the Checkout History interface. All data should
    display in its appropriate row.

    LP1593834: Add Date Header to A/T Email Examples
    
    RFCs 822 and 2822 specify that a Date: header has to be sent
    indicating when an email was sent. Without this, clients that
    default to displaying the Sent Date may end up using a "NULL"
    date, or 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC, which is not ideal. This
    adds the header to the example A/T templates for email and
    SMS messages, and includes instructions on correcting
    existing tempalates.

    These tests check that the copy status is correct after aborting
    transits dependent upon the status of the copy.  More tests could be
    added to cover more situations, but these tests cover the basics.

    LP 1306666: Abort Transit Only Change Copy Status if In Transit
    
    When aborting a transit, the copy status is presently changed, either
    to the status stored in action.transit_copy or to Reshelving if the
    transit was for a hold.  This causes problems with "hanging" transits
    where something was not handled properly before.  We've had cases
    where a transit sticks around on a copy that is later checked out, and
    while that copy is checked out, the transit is aborted, thus setting
    the copy status to Reshelving when it should be Checked Out.
    
    The code change in this branch only changes the copy's status if it is
    In Transit.  A copy in any other status has its status left untouched.

    LP#1476049: disable serve-cgi-bin Apache config on Jessie
    
    This patch ensures that the stock Apache configuration
    "serve-cgi-bin" is disabled when installing on Debian Jessie,
    as otherwise the default cgi-bin location
    can override what Evergreen specifies for offline.pl.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Run the Makefile.install step on Jessie; verify
        that there is no /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/serve-cgi-bin.conf
        symlink.
    [2] Proceed with the rest of the Evergreen installation; verify
        that the Apache error log doesn't contain a warning like this:
    
        "The Alias directive in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/eg.conf ...
         will probably never match because it overlaps an earlier
         ScriptAlias."
    
    [3] For extra credit, verify that one can access offline circulation
        sessions.

    LP#1611495 Don't use .xml for MARC21 files in Vandelay Export
    
    The new 'Export Non-imported Records' feature in Vandelay (see bug
    LP#1548147) was tweaked before merge to export MARC21 files by default
    (rather than MARC-XML). However, the file save dialog still defaults to
    (and filters by) ".xml" for the file extension. This is confusing and
    otherwise problematic.
    
    Let's go ahead and save the export using a ".mrc" extension instead.
    While not an official extension (as far as I know), it is widely used,
    easy to understand, and far less likely to cause issues with other
    software.

    LP1559281: Allow Baker and Taylor Fake ISBNs
    
    For Content Cafe, jam two B&T entrys into the hash so that Business::ISBN
    doesn't register them as invalid prefix ISBNs.
    
    B&T uses internal ISBN's with country codes 630 and 631 for materials
    ordered through them when no assigned ISBN exists.  The ContentCafe
    added content service knows about these ISBNs, but they are not generally
    used by other providers.
    
    To Test:  This only works if you are using the ContentCafe added content provider.
    
     - Before Patch -
    1. Add the isbn 9786315820243 as the only isbn on a record. Remove UPCs also..
    2. Clear the added content cache by restarting memcached or using the staff link.
    3. View record in catalog and you should see no cover art.
    
     - After Patch -
    1. Clear the added content cache.
    2. View the record in the catalog and you should now see cover art for the title
    "Video games: the movie"
