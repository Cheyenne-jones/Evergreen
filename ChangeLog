	* correcting upgrade script for recent vandelay.replace_field
	  improvements

	* addressing two Breaker-format issues: 1) supply an "empty"
	  (space) value for indicators in the internal format if they are
	  left out and 2) add indicator placeholders to incoming Breaker
	  datafield lines if they seem to be missing. Addresses

	* When the subfield delimiter is configured as "$" (the default),
	  use {dollar} to represent a literal dollar sign. This is
	  apparently in line with other Breaker-format tools. Fix suggested
	  by Galen Charlton, thanks gmc!

	* Fix exception thrown in MARC editor searching for bib sources
	  
	  As reported in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/695526,
	  the attempt to retrieve all of the config.bib_source values using
	  openils.PermaCrud was failing because the retrieveAll() method
	  relies on fieldmapper.IDL's setting of the
	  fieldmapper[hint].Identifier property for each class - but in the
	  1.6 releases, we're still using fmclasses in XUL instead of
	  fieldmapper.AutoIDL.
	  
	  So, to fix the direct problem, we can simply set the property
	  ourselves on the desired class before invoking retrieveAll();
	  this avoids touching code paths that might have wider unintended
	  consequences.
