    Lp 1735539: Fix Item Status ability to delete multiple copies.
    
    Use the notify handler instead of the resolve handler to collect our
    copies.  This ensures we get them all instead of just the last one.
    
    To reproduce the bug:
       1. Open Item Status in the web staff client.
       2. Load multiple items, perhaps by uploading a file of barcodes.
       3. Select more than 1 item from the list.
       4. Choose "Delete Items" from the Actions menu.
       5. Note that the dialog indicates that you will delete 1 copy.
       6. Click the Cancel button in the dialog.
    
    To test, after applying the fix branch:
       1. Open Item Status in the web staff client.
       2. Load multiple items, perhaps by uploading a file of barcodes.
       3. Select more than 1 item from the list.
       4. Choose "Delete Items" from the Actions menu.
       5. Note that that the dialog indicates you will delete X copies,
          where X is the number of items selected.
       6. Click OK and confirm that all copies were deleted.
       7. You can confirm 6 by reloading the interface and uploading the
          file of barcodes again.

    LP#1729934 Webstaff display org-scoped penalties
    
    Consistent with the XUL client, only display patron standing penalties
    (AKA Messages) that are linked to an org unit which is an ancestor,
    matching, or descendant org unit of the workstation (e.g. the full
    path).
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Create a patron Message which applies to a branch using a branch or
    null-depth penalty (e.g. at BR1).
    
    [2] Create a second message that links to the root org unit (e.g. CONS)
    via depth=0 penalty.
    
    [2] Log out and back in to the browser client at a workstation under a
    different section of the org unit tree (e.g. BR3) and confirm the
    Messages created at BR1 do not display, but the messages created at CONS
    do.

    LP#1738488 Optimize Flattener join logic
    
    The current Flattener.pm autogenerates necessary joins for sorting
    and filtering, but in doing so, it gives every intermediate table a
    unique alias, even if the path to that table is exactly the same as
    another member in the map we are flattening.
    
    Instead, let's reuse joins whenever the path is identical, even for
    intermediate tables.  We do so by tracking every path to each core
    type, then reusing as much of that join path as we can.  In cases
    where we have different paths to the same type, we still necessarily
    provide a new unique alias.
    
    This problem was first noticed in the web staff billing history
    interface, where the particular stacking of joins resulted (for one
    specific library) in 17 joins and 44,575,740,147,225,592,344,870,912
    potential rows.
