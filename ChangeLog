    Since this bug came about due to negative balance changes (and it was
    easier), this commit extends the existing negative balances test suite
    to include basic tests for checking both xact_finish conditions.
    
    One of these tests fails without the fix from the previous commit.

    Avoid re-closing a circulation that was re-opened during checkin because
    it acquired a non-zero balance.  This is typically caused by, for
    example, voiding a lost item fee during checkin and/or generating
    overdues for lost-then-found items.

    LP#1167541: Use Patron home org for pickup lib instead of staff's
    
    When staff are placing a hold for a patron, we should use the patron's
    preferred pickup location, and failing that, their home library rather
    than the staff's home library.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the web staff client, search for a title to place
        a hold request on, using a patron record
        whose home library is different from the home library of
        the staff member you are logged in as.
    [2] Note that the pickup location defaults to the staff
        account's home library.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step #1. This time, the default
        pickup library should be the home library of the patron.
    [4] Set a preferred pickup location for the patron, then
        repeat step #1. This time, the default pickup library
        should be the preferred pickup location just set.
    [5] Repeat steps #1-#4 using the XUL staff client; note that
        for step #3, it will be necessary to rebuild the client.

    LP#1175293 Use filtered fund dropdown in funding source interface
    
    The exising interface for allocating to funds from a funding source
    view lists all funds by code only.  Since many (most?) orgs reuse
    fund codes year to year, you eventually end up with a bunch of
    dupes you cannot tell apart.
    
    Let's "borrow" an AutoFieldWidget to do the heavy lifting of creating
    a filtered list of active funds, and include the year for further
    user validation.
    
    This is inspired by a few other fund dropdowns, but may not be the
    best overall solution.

    We test both the case where an output encoding has been explicitly declared,

    It was this subtle difference that was causing the problem with output_string().

    LP#1576435: Force "Include inactive patrons?" on patron reg duplicate search
    
    In the XUL client, duplicate patron checking in the patron registration
    interface now includes inactive patrons (see LP#1217052).  However, if
    you click on the link "Found X patron(s) with the same name," the
    resulting patron search does not always include inactive patrons by
    default (instead, the value of the "Include inactive patrons?" checkbox
    is cached from your last patron search, as usual).
    
    To prevent user confusion in this scenario, this commit forces the
    linked patron search in the XUL client to always include inactive
    patrons.

    LP#1528647 Self-check only accepts user name value if regex for barcode
    not set up
    
    The original fix only worked if password was not required for self-check.
    This fix allows it to work when password is required as well.

    LP1584891: Export MARC holdings with UTF8 subfields
    
    The --items option of marc_export adds a new MARC 852 field with a
    number of subfields that it retrieves from the database. If those
    subfields (such as call number, copy location, etc) contain Unicode
    characters, then we need to decode the incoming UTF8 characters
    when adding the subfield values to avoid corrupting the MARC.

    LP#1618624 Fix thinko in adjust-to-zero
    
    It appears that this test was written for an 'unless' instead of
    an 'if'.  'if' seems just as natural here, so let's go that route.
    
    This should prevent us from closing circulations prematurely, and
    also close them when we need to.

    LP#1667835: avoid edi_fetcher.pl crash upon fetching zero-length file
    
    This patch fixes an issue that could cause edi_fetcher.pl to crash
    if the EDI partner supplies a zero-length file for Net::FTP to
    download; such files are now skipped.
    
    Testing would entail setting up an FTP server that contains a
    zero-length file, then setting up an EDI remote account and
    using edi_fetcher.pl to try to retrieve the file.

    Using the url filter in TT2 causes named anchors to
    be escaped in such a way that urls including them
    will likely return a 404. Since the url is being
    used in an html document, the html filter is
    sufficient and allows the url to work as intended.

    LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that failed parsing
    
    Avoid fetching and creating edi_message entries for EDI messages that
    the system cannot parse.
    
    In the event parsing failed due to a temporary condition (e.g. Ruby
    translator was not running), messages can be reprocessed by either
    deleting the offending edi_message row or setting its status to 'retry'.
    
    See previous commit ("LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that
    failed processing") for a more detailed explanation.

commit 7e335da96df74748265c8bc016ecc5dbe53740c5
Author: Galen Charlton <gmc@equinoxinitiative.org>

    LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that failed processing
    
    At present, the EDI fetcher ignores files (as determined by file
    name and EDI account details) that were already successfully
    processed. With this patch, ones that failed processing (e.g.,
    acq.edi_message.state = 'proc_error') previously are ignored
    as well.
    
    This is because most processing errors reflect conditions that
    require some sort of manual intervention on the part of the materials
    vendor or the Evergreen user; having edi_fetcher.pl simply redownload
    and attempt to process the file has no effect other than causing
    the acq.edi_message table to grow.
    
    With this patch, the appearance of rows in acq.edi_message whose
    state is 'proc_error' should be taken as a signal to the Evergreen
    admin to investigate and resolve whatever issue caused the
    message to not be processed; after doing that, removing the
    acq.edi_message rows will allow the file to be downloaded again
    (assuming it's still available on the file server).
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Arrange to create or simulate an EDI message that failed
        processing.
    [2] Run edi_fetcher.pl to have it attempt to download the
        failed message in step #1; verify that the file is
        /not/ downloaded again and that no additonal acq.edi_message
        rows are created for it.
