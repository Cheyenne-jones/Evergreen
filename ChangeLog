    LP#1579225: fix handling of passwords in patron registration
    
    This patch improves how the new password hashing is invoked
    by open-ils.actor.patron.update; in particular, it fixes
    a problem whereby newly registered patrons could not
    log in.  It also fixes other issues:
    
    - actor.usr.passwd would be set to an MD5 of the password
      for new users, vitiating the strong hashes in actor.passwd
    - certain types of updates via patron registration, such as
      adding or deleting addresses, could result in the patron's
      password getting doubly-hashed, thereby locking them out
      of their account.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Register a new patron; verify that they can log in.
    [2] Edit an existing patron and change their password; verify
        that they can log in.
    [3] Edit an existing patron but do NOT change their password;
        verify that they can still log in.
    [4] Inspect the actor.usr rows for these patrons and verify
        that actor.usr.passwd is set to the value MD5(''), not
        the MD5 of their password.

    Docs: Undo heading name change to fix broken link
    
    This commit reverts a chapter heading change, which had broken an
    internal cross reference link, thus causing the HTML docs to fail to
    build. In this case, it seems best to keep the older heading rather than
    fix the link to it.
    
    In general, we should be careful about changing any AsciiDoc
    headings, since we currently rely on autogenerated section IDs when
    making internal links, and changing a heading changes its ID. If a
    heading is changed, then all links to it need to be changed accordingly.
    
    This commit also corrects a heading underline.

    LP#1031335 No-op the escape_email_header helper
    
    As suggested by Mike Rylander, keep the escape_email_header helper
    around to avoid breaking templates that already adopted it, but make it
    a no-op as the SendEmail reactor now encodes the email headers of
    interest by default.
