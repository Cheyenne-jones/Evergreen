    LP#1429268 credit card payment address fall-thru
    
    When a patron has no mailing address linked, attempt to read address
    data from the patron's billing address.  Similarly, if all address
    fields are properly set by the API caller, except the country, and the
    patron has no addresses, attempt to determine the country from org unit
    settings.
    
    If insufficient address data is provided or divined, return an invalid
    params Event (similar to other CC failures).
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Create a patron record that has no mailing address but does
        have a billing address.  Perform or simulate a credit card
        payment; it shoudl fail with an internal error.
    [2] Apply the patch and repeat step 1; this time, the payment
        attempt should succeed and use the billing address.

    LP#1539088: marc_export prints "Waiting for input" when non-interactive
    
    This commit modifies marc_export to only print "Waiting for input"
    when run in an interactive manner.  This suppresses the output when
    run from a pipe.
    
    To test this change:
    
    Before the commit is applied both of the following command lines will
    output "Waiting for input" to standard error:
    
    $ marc_export --format XML
    
    $ echo <bibid> | marc_export --format XML
    
    Where you replace <bibid> with a bibliographic record entry id from
    your database.
    
    After the commit is applied, only the first command line will output
    the "Waiting for input" message.

    LP#1522538: Improper detection of jtitle search type
    
    Before this change, the system would only check the first qtype URL parameter
    to see if it needed to apply the journal title "bib_level(s)" filter.  Instead
    it should check each qtype in turn while it turns an advanced search into a
    simple search string.  Here the code is moved into place to accomplish that.
    
    To test, load all test datasets into a fresh database.  Perform an advanced
    search on journal title for "proceedings" (no quotes) using the second search
    input row.  Before this commit, two records are retrieved.  After, only one
    is retrieved.

    Second, and most importantly, force all connections to the web
    staff client to be redirected through an HTTPS connection. By
    default the system would accept whichever connection type you
    enter by hand, and fewer and fewer people actually enter the

    LP#1530158: ensure that Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro is installed
    
    Business::OnlinePayment::PayflowPro is a Perl module required if
    the user wants to use PayflowPro as a credit card processor; without
    it, attempts to make payments in TPAC using that processor will fail
    with an internal server error.
    
    This patch ensures that the module will get installed on Debian,
    Ubuntu, and Fedora.
    
    Strictly speaking, the Perl module is strictly optional, as
    Business::OnlinePayment uses lazy loading for its drivers, but this
    patch is making the assumption that its easiest all around if
    we just install all dependencies that an Evergreen application
    server might need.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Install or upgrade Evergreen, then run settings-tester.pl to
        verify that the module is installed.

    LP#1526543 Truthiness check for reset_password is flawed
    
    We expect boolean options in config.tt2 to be 'true' or 'false',
    but the code was simple asking 'IF reset_password', which is true
    for either value.
    
    Instead, match on the string (as we do in other places).
    
    To test:
    - Load the stock catalog login page
    - Notice the "Forgot your password?" link staying no matter which way
      'reset_password' is set in config.tt2
    - Apply patch, and change 'reset_password' value in config.tt2 to 'false'
    - RESULT: Password reset link doesn't show up

    LP#1519925 - Allow MARC Federated Search to search UPC index of local catalog.
    
    If a organization added UPC search for certain Z39.50 servers then the UPC search box
    would display in the MARC Federated Search interface, but the local catalog would
    not be searched.  This adds the ability to search the local catalog "Evergreen Catalog"
    UPC index from that interface.
    
    Confirm the Issue:
    
    1. To trigger the initial problem you need a Z39.50 server setup that includes a UPC
    Search.  For OCLC the following Z39.50 attributes add UPC searching.
    Name:upc, Label:UPC, Code:1007, Format:4, Truncation:0
    
    2. Now the MARC Federated Search should include a UPC search option.  Try searching
    for a UPC that exists in the local catalog.  Nothing should come up.
    
    After patch applied:
    
    1. Now if you search for a UPC in the MARC Federated Search that you know exists,
    it will show up.
