    LP#1390225: Fail to care about errors from auth.session.delete
    
    We're just tossing this call over the wall and moving on.  We don't
    care if the session wasn't there to delete or even if we didn't pass
    a session to the server.

    lp1383763 - Display OpenURL embargo statement
    
    The ResolverResolver service fetches the embargo statement (such as
    "Last year not available") from OpenURL resolvers and stores it in a
    target_embargo field. In JSPAC we used to display this along with the
    coverage statement, because it is very important that people know that a
    resource may be available from 1999 but the last year isn't available
    online.

    LP#1379824 Make PermaCrud.js disconnect() actually disconnect
    
    The disconnect() method in PermaCrud.js was meant to wrap the
    underlying session disconnect, but it never actually disconnected
    the session.  This could lead to problems in long-living PermaCrud
    objects, as they may think they are still connected when they are not
    (the session remote_id is never cleared).
    
    Also, remove a couple (now redundant) manual session.disconnect() calls.

    As described in the bug, the library setting "Self Check: Patron Login Timeout

    It looks like some of it was already being pulled in, like the variable, but
    the interface was not utilizing it.
    
    This commit borrows from the old JS selfcheck and implements a default of
    three minutes for selfcheck timeout otherwise handled by the library setting.

    Fix LP904860, Cannot print a patron address label
    
    The sequence of events for printing an address label is as follows.
    Staff client Code in the util/print.js file builds an HTML page of the
    address label.  The page includes two vital components, 1) a source tag
    to pull 'print_win.js' file from the server, and 2) an onload event
    handler bound to the body tag to execute a 'print_init()' function that
    is defined in the source tag.
    
    However, print_init() is undefined because the source tag contains a
    badly formed URL. It needs to be prefixed by 'oils://remote' so that the
    new 'oils:' protocol can be used to pull the file remotely from the
    server.

    Ensure that the list of previous issuances is sorted correctly (on

    copy location (when serial.prev_issuance_copy_location is enabled).
    
    The data comes sorted from the DB, but the sorting was lost during the

    order of hash keys, which is undefined.

    LP#1361801: Add required fields to serial issuance form
    
    This commit prevents issuances from being created without a date_published
    or holding_code. This has two benefits:
    
      1. Prevents uncaught exceptions related to submitting null values for
         either of those fields.
      2. Requiring date_published prevents an ugly error when trying to
         predict new issuances from an issuance without a date_published.
    
    This commit does NOT provide any feedback to the user about which fields
    are required. That would require further investigation into the Dojo/Dijit
    objects being used for the edit form fields.

    LP#1246859: Improve username flow for staged users
    
    Staged users in most cases have a username that consists of a UUID.
    
    Rather than leave the UUID as their username or require staff to
    clear the field and replace it with a barcode or other value, it
    would be better to remove this username when loading the staged user
    in the user editor.
    
    This commit clears the username when loading a stage user if the
    username looks like a UUID.
    
    If a barcode has been staged for the loaded staged user, the
    username will be populated with that value.
    
    If there is no staged barcode, the username will remain blank and
    will be populated using the standard method after staff enters a
    value in the barcode field.

    LP1309131 - Fix series link
    
    Clicking on a series link with a hyphen failed because the hyphen was
    stripped and the two words are joined together. This branch changes
    series.tts to replace special characters with a space, which is similar to
    the links we build for authors.

    LP#1325720 Repair fund rollover year selector query
    
    Dojo dojo stores track values as strings, so values used in data store
    queries must be coerced into strings before performing the query.
    
    This fixes the year query in the fund rollover UI so that the page is
    able to render the results of a rollover without dying from an JS error
    before completing.

    LP#1292129: Removed deleted call numbers from the search results to properly show copy count.
    
    The SQL in fm_IDL.xml for setting up the reporter source "Hold/Copy
    Ratio per Bib" includes deleted call numbers which in turn can give
    an incorrect copy count. The ratio appears to still be correct because
    deleted copies are considered in the ratio calculation, but not the
    copy count that is displayed.

    LP#1358916: refuse to retrieve over-large MARC records via Z39.50
    
    At least one malformed record discovered in the wild can
    cause open-ils.search backends to balloon to over 3G of memory
    consumption.  This patch works around that by refusing
    to process any (MARC) Z39.50 results that are larger than the
    MARC record maximum of 99,999 octets.

    The limit and offset parameters can cause patrons to be stuck in a small
    section of their current checkout lists. Let's remove those two parameters
    when linking to that list from the patron dashboard.

    LP#1359934: prevent error opening patron search form
    
    As a result of the patch for OpenSRF bug 1316245, JSON2js
    in the OpenSRF library is now stricter -- in particular, passing
    an undefined value to it results in an exception being thrown.
    
    This patch runs with the increased strictness and fixes an
    issue where the patron search form was passing an undefined value
    to JSON2js.
