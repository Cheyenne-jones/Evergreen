    lp1642035: Editing User Hold Preferences
    
    The JS for hold notification values was replacing rather
    than concatenating so only the furthest-right true value
    would be saved. And because an ng-if directive creates
    a child scope[1], the hold_notify_sms primitive could
    never be true. Changed hold_notify_* to an object to
    avoid this.
    
    An ng-model directive was added to enable
    opac.default_sms_notify but opac.default_sms_carrier
    will still require some work to enable / replace.
    
    [1]:https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes
    
    Testing:
    
    pre-patch:
    Try to do anything with default sms number, fail.
    Try to set more than one of phone + email notification, fail.
    Try to set sms notification to anything, fail.
    
    post-patch:
    Default sms notify value is populated and can be changed.
    All 8 possible combinations of hold notify options can be set.
    
    Still can't set opac.default_sms_carrier value, needs additional work.

    LP#1691473 Internal Apache HTTP port configuration
    
    Adds an optional new Apache/mod_perl configuration variable for defining
    the port Apache listens on for HTTP traffic.  This resolves an issue
    where added content lookups attempting HTTP requests on the local Apache
    instance on port 80 failed because Apache was using non-standard ports.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Set a value for OILSWebInternalHTTPPort that's not "80".
    [2] Restart/reload Apache
    [3] Load a record detail in the catalog
    [4] Confirm opensrf logs show:
    
    "tpac: added content connecting to <ip-address>:<new-port> / <hostname>
    
    <new-port> should be the value configured for OILSWebInternalHTTPPort.

    circs occur in the patron checkout interface.
    
    Consistent with the XUL client, avoid updating tab-level 'items out'
    counts with non-cat circs.
    
    Adds a new work log action for 'noncat_checkout' so the correct data can
    be extracted.  As with the XUL client, this appears in the work log as a
    'checkout' with no copy.

    LP#1686194 Account for adjustments when generating fines
    
    Fine generation stops at a predetermined 'max fines' amount, but this
    does not account for possible adjustments which lower the effective
    fine amount.  This situation is common in cases where lost items are
    returned, and the library wants to generate additional overdues upon
    that event.
    
    With this commit, fine generation will pull in any adjustments applied
    to overdue fines, and use those to offset the current total fine when
    checking for max fines.
    
    Also includes test for this condition.

    Specifically for stat cats, we mark the select statements as required if the
    corresponding stat cat is required, but we can also start using HTML5 validation
    tests elsewhere in the form now as well.
    
    I also fixed the <NONE> entries so that they display instead of blank entries,
    and forced the Price, Cost, and Deposit Amount fields to be of input type number,
    though you could still enter invalid numbers here from the database's POV, so
    better validation tests are still needed there.

    LP#1616980 webstaff: protect "magic statuses" when editing copies
    
    This patch fixes a bug where the web staff volume/copy editor
    could be used to put items in or out of the following status:
    
    1 - Checked out
    3 - Lost
    6 - In transit
    8 - On holds shelf
    16 - Long Overdue
    18 - Canceled Transit
    
    To test
    -------
    1. Choose to "Edit Items" on an Available copy.
    2. Status field is fully editable. Click to open the dropdown
    3. Click "Checked out"
    4. Click "Save & Exit"
    5. Result is that the item status changes to 'checked out',
       which should not happen.
    6. Choose to "Edit Items" on an Checked out copy.
    7. Status field is fully editable. Click to open the dropdown
    8. Click "Available"
    9. Click "Save & Exit"
    10. Result is that the item status changes to 'available'.
    11. Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-10. This time, the magic
        status are marked as disabled in the copy status selector.
        If the item is already in one of the magic statuses, if the
        user attempts to change the status, the interface will appear
        to allow it, but the change will be silently ignored.

    LP1690434: Date Comparisons in the Reporter
    
    Because of the way the where clause is constructed
    in queries using the Year + Month Transform reports
    using some types of operators could produce invalid
    SQL.
    
    To test:
    put together a simple report template with a date
    in the Basic Filters section, using the Year + Month
    transform and the On or After operator. (a count of
    circs with an xact_start filter is a simple way to
    set this up.) Schedule it with a relative date
    such as 1 month ago and run it.
    
    Pre Patch: the report will fail and the error text
    will reference a missing text >= double precision
    comparison function.
    
    Post Patch: you'll get a count of how many circs
    were opened last month (or whatever report you
    wrote).

    LP#1694497: fix record links on 2nd+ page of grouped results
    
    This patch fixes a bug wherein the second (and subsequent)
    pages of search results in the public catalog (when group
    formats and editions is in effect) does not correctly generate
    links to hits that are not part of of a multi-bib metarecords.
    
    To test
    -------
    1. Keyword search concerto for "piano"
    2. Check the box for "Group formats and Editions"
    3. Click Page 2
    4. Click any result that is not a group (missing the parentheses after
       the title). You will get redirected to the my account page.
    5. Apply the patch and do steps #1-4 again. This time, you should
       end up on the record details page.

    LP1312824 open-ils.circ.hold.change_title fix
    
    Add a capture_time => undef limit to both change_title
    APIs to prevent currently captured holds from being reset
    when moving holds from one title to another.
    More work is needed to prevent items currently in transit
    from having their transits canceled.
    
    Test plan
    ---------
    1. Create a bib with multiple holdings
    2. Add multiple holds to this title and capture one of them - Item
       will have a status of On Holds Shelf
    3. Open another bib record, open Actions for this Record menu,
       Mark as Hold Transfer Destination
    4. Return to the record that has a captured hold, open Actions for
       this Record, Transfer all Title Holds
    5. Check Captured hold, Item status is Available, hold has been reset
       and now points to the new bib record.
    
    With the patch applied, steps 2-5 above should be repeated, but this
    time in step 5 the hold will still be on the original record and the
    item's status will still be On Holds Shelf.

    Docs: Fix buggy AsciiDoc rendering of backticks
    
    Apparently, AsciiDoc matches backticks (`) with single quotes (') as a
    valid quote pair, and this happens before matching a pair of backticks.
    So in cases where a pair of backticks is followed by only one single
    quote (not within a word), the first backtick is treated as a single
    quote, thus breaking the backtick pair and not applying the intended
    monospace formatting.
    
    This commit fixes two such cases by escaping the backticks. This doesn't
    prevent the same problem in the future, but I haven't found any way to
    change this parsing behavior.
