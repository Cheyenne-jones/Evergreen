    LP#1424755: Org Unit Setting view permissions can be bypassed
    
    Fix private org. unit setting leakage by forcing the $auth argument
    to true if not passed in when open-ils.actor.ou_setting.ancestor_default
    or open-ils.actor.ou_setting.ancestor_default.batch are called.
    
    Other than a change to the desc of the public methods to reflect that
    they now check permissions if permissions are required, there are no
    required api changes to the back or the front ends.

    LP#1206589: Temporary Fix for Org. Unit Settings History Bug
    
    This commit makes two changes to the coustl IDL entry.
    
    1. It adds a retrieve permission of STAFF_LOGIN.  This at least
    requires someone with staff permission to be able to view settings
    history.
    
    2. It fixed the primary key field from date_applied to id.  The
    prior setting was just an outright error.
    
    NOTE: This is intended as a short term fix for the Library Settings
    Editor history feature.

    Docs: fix asciidoc errors
    
    When https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1386854 was merged to add a new
    docs section for "Locally hosted content", it looks like there was a bad git
    conflict resolution and an extra block of ======= was left behind.
    
    Remove this to fix headings and table of contents for the documentation site.

    Documentation: LP#1386854 - Locally Hosted Added Content.
    
    Adds documentation that describes how to use the local content bypass
    feature of the AddedContent modules.  This allows for local added content like
    cover art, reviews, TOC, exerpts or annotations to be shown in bib records.
    
    I also changed the headers in the External Added Content section to use title case.

    We're just tossing this call over the wall and moving on.  We don't
    care if the session wasn't there to delete or even if we didn't pass
    a session to the server.
