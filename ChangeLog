    Optimize away always-true hold count clause
    
    When rendering results in the tpac we request hold counts for each record.
    Most of the time (that is, whenever org unit hiding is /not/ in use) we
    filter, essentially, on "where pickup_lib is in the org tree".  This is
    both useless and slow, so this commit will recognize that and optimize the
    test away.

    Avoid Z39.50 search warning for uninit var
    
    The debug log blindly attempts to access list members that might not
    exist (if, for example, an event code was returned from the attempt to
    run do_service_search()), thus generating spurious log warnings.
    Instead, move the debug line to only generate output when we have
    created the list item in question.

    Authorities: 4XX fields have wrong names
    
    In Evergreen we have authority fields defined in the database that
    relate to control sets.  These are used somewhere today (I'm fuzzy on
    that at the moment; some places once had and may still have hardcoded
    labels) but they also will be used by the bib and auth browser
    that's not yet merged to master (see LP #1177810).
    
    The 4XX tags among the set I'm talking about (in
    authority.control_set_authority_fields) are mislabled, saying See Also
    where they ought to say See From, e.g.

    Make AuthProxy LDAP bind code more robust
    
    The existing version of LDAP_Auth.pm assumed that the user's
    bind DN could be derived from the base DN, the ID attribute, and
    the user's ID.  This is frequently the case, but not always,
    particularly in Active Directory setups using sAMAccountName. This
    commit instead uses the initial LDAP lookup as the authority for
    determining the user's DN.

    LP#1193204 Fixes error with generate_fines
    
    If an overdue is returned after a closed date, the generate_fines code
    will not generate fines for those items because the section of code that
    checks for closed dates returns from the function if a closed date is
    encountered.
    
    For example, if an item is due on June 29th, but is not returned until
    after July 1st (Canada Day), then when fines are generated for the item,
    generate_fines creates a fine for the 30th of June, but when it
    gets to the 1st of July it encouters a closed date and executes a
    'return' statement which exits the generate_fines code causing the
    fine from June 30th to be rolled back as well as preventing further
    fines from being created.
    
    This fix replaces the 'return' statements inside the 'for' loop
    that is nested within the eval with 'next' statements.

    Fix LP1177916, Cannot activate PO which contains only direct charges
    We add a safety check in the function
    Application/Acq/Order.pm/create_lineitem_list_assets(), which is called
    by create_po_assets(), which is the service call initiated by the user
    trying to activate a PO.
    
    The safety check prevents the function from processing if there are no
    line items specified in the arguments.
    
    P.S. It would be better to stop the sequence of events earlier in the
    client, but that will need more coding, which can been done in another
    fix.

    Patron Editor can enter erroneous values for Claims-returned count
    
    In the staff client, Patrons interface, Edit screen, when
    mouse-scrolling up and down the Edit form, it is possible to
    inadvertently change the value in Claims-returned Count or Claims Never
    Checked Out Count field.  It will happen if the mouse hovers over either
    data field while using the mouse wheel.
    
    Both data fields use the dijit.form.NumberSpinner widget to provide a
    'spin' behaviour.  The fix involves cancelling the mouse scroll event as
    it propagates to input fields in table rows that are using the
    dijit.form.NumberSpinner widget, because the mouse scroll would be

    Correct Linux staff client build instructions
    
    There were a few things going on here; 2.3 introduced linux32-client and
    linux64-client targets, so the old linux-client Make target no longer
    worked.
    
    Also, Wine isn't generally how many of us would recommend running staff
    clients when there's a perfectly good native client likely to better
    support printing, etc.
    
    Also, rather than pointing at evergreen-ils.org for downloads, which
    won't work in many situations (and which prevents the use of the
    auto-update mechanism), use the "updates" target to point at the locally
    downloadable clients. Eventually we'll properly document the use of
    auto-updates, but for now this is hopefully a step in the right
    direction.

    Recent installs of 2.3, or upgrades during 2.3, will have introduced

    Retain index granularity with minimal bloat
    
    The previous approach to reducing index bloat arguably went too far, in
    that analytics such as separately catalogued songs for an album were all
    simply aggregated together in a single metabib.title_field_entry row,
    rather than being added as separated metabib.title_field_entry rows for
    each unique value.
    
    To avoid the original problem of exact duplicate rows being inserted, we
    now check for an existing matching row before inserting into the index.
    A good test record is title "Cello concerto." which results in 1 title
    proper row and 4 added entry title rows in metabib.title_field_entry
    after this change.

    Bring back "split-brain" indexing normalization
    
    Before 2.4-era changes to indexing and search, normalizers were applied
    in a way that resulted in different effects on the value and index_vector
    columns of metabib.*field_entry tables.  This behavior was lost during
    the changes mentioned above, but we need it for several things to work
    properly, phrase search and (likely) facets among them.  This commit
    brings that behavior back.
    
    See here for the original behavioral documentation:

    Reduce index bloat involving non-search_field values
    
    Rows in metabib.title_field_entry, subject_field_entry,
    series_field_entry, and author_field_entry are doubled or tripled due to
    bad logic in biblio.extract_metabib_field_entry. This results in these
    tables being 2 or more times their correct size.
    
    This was introduced in 2.2.0 when the logic for browse_field and
    facet_field were added to biblio.extract_metabib_field_entry. 2.1 is not
    affected.
    
    The duplicates are caused when biblio.extract_metabib_field_entry
    returns TRUE in the search_field column for all rows even if they should
    just be facet_field or browse_field after the first search_field value
    is returned.

    Only attempt to map copies once per hold
    
    The development of Calculated Proximity Adjustment (CPA) for 2.4 added a "prox"
    column to action.hold_copy_map (ahcm) to store on variant of copy proximity.  That
    value is calculated at the same time that certain other data structures are
    set up, and is conceptually tied to them, so the resulting combined data
    set is used to insert values into the ahcm.  However, user configuration
    can cause that data set to contain non-unique values, where the data structure
    used previous to CPA was guaranteed to be unique.  This lack of uniqueness
    would then violate a constraint on the achm table.  This commit restores the
    required uniqueness for the purpose of creating the ahcm rows.

    Support script-based circ in nearest_hold()
    
    The nearest_hold() implementation recently changed to pull in the circ
    library ID; however, if circulation runs through scripts, the circ
    library on the copy object has been fleshed, and the nearest hold
    routine gets very confused.
    
    Check to see if we do, in fact, have an object instead of a plain
    scalar, and assign the value to a placeholder variable accordingly.
    
    Thanks to Jeff Godin for his great assistance on debugging this!

    Repair fine generator memory leak
    
    Calling "next" from within a "try" block results in a memory leak,
    presumably because "try" is a tangled nest of subs and evals.
    Replacing the "try" with a good ol' "eval" avoids the leak.
    
    This can be reproduced with the following:
    
    ---------
    use Error qw/:try/;
    
    foreach (0..200000) {
        try {
            next;
        } catch Error with {
        };
    }
    ---------
    
    This particular leak in the fine generator is onerous when the fine
    generator is run often (e.g. every 15 mins), which means circs that
    have already been processed for the day are re-analzyed over and over,
    causing the code to continue early (next) to the next loop iteration
    for large numbers of circs.  It also happens when a circs are skipped
    because they have no fine interval, rate, or max fine.
    
    You know this is happening because you will see something like this in
    the storage stderr log:
    
    Exiting eval via next at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/OpenILS/Application/Storage/Publisher/action.pm
    line 820.
    
    Exiting subroutine via next at
    /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/OpenILS/Application/Storage/Publisher/action.pm
    line 820.
    
    This patch does not avoid the "exiting eval via next" warning, since
    we're still next'ing out of the eval.  It just avoids the memory leak
    (and the "Exiting subroutine" warning).  More extensive refactoring is
    needed to to completely remove the second warning.

    Use the centralized initialization method for QP
    
    QueryParser maintains an effective singleton for internal configuration of
    the driver in order to avoid going to the database on every search request
    to gather configuration parameters.  There is also a centralized sub that
    has the task of properly configuring said singleton.  Previous to this commit
    we were not using that centralized initializer in one case, and that case
    happened to be the most important initialization of QP in all of Evergreen.
    The fallout from that was that some configuration was not being gathered
    and passed to QueryParser, resulting in incorrect search SQL being generated.
    
    This is rectified by using the centralized initializer everywhere that it
    is needed and can be used -- and particularly in the effected case.

    When placing holds in TPAC via the staff client, the focus had been on the

    This can potentially save staff from having to perform an extra click to

    of the user they plan to create a hold on behalf of.

    Acq: Be fuzzy about case when retrieving EDI documents
    
    The edi_fetcher relies on a routine in OpenILS::Acq::EDI to, among
    other things, try to avoid fetching the same EDI document multiple times
    when many rows in acq.edi_account refer to the same host and login
    credentials.
    
    Since in practice most vendors seem to run FTP servers for EDI on
    Windows, not UNIX, and pathnames are therefore case-insensitive, that
    test for other occurrences ought also to be case-insensitive.
    
    If I were to look at this as a purist, I could argue that vendor servers
    might sometimes by run on UNIX, and that for some reason it is possible
    that different vendor-to-buyer EDI documents (order responses or
    invoices) could have pathnames that differ only in the case of some
    characters.  But that seems wildly unlikely.  If anyone does take this
    possibility seriously, perhaps acq.edi_account needs a Boolean column to
    indicate the remote host's case [in]sensitivity.

    TPAC: Death date missing from authors in record details
    
    The trailing period prescribed by ISBD punctuation for x00 $d subfields
    in certain circumstances confounds the regex that was expected the $d
    subfield to match ^\s*\d{4}-\d{4}\s*$. As a result, death dates were
    often being omitted from the record detail display. Relaxing the regex
    to match against a trailing .* instead of \s* resolves the issue.

    Fix Launchpad Bug 1183418.
    
    Clicking on an author with a dash or dates in the name on the search
    results page comes up with 0 results. It looks like the dash is stripped
    from the date and/or name.
    
    Clicking on such a link from the record view actually works because
    the dash is replaced with a space.
    
    This branch changes table.tt2 to replace special characters in author
    output with a space in the same way that authors.tt2 does.

    Correct subfield format for authority lookup
    
    The Authority Control Set code expects the format of subfields
    that it will be used to build a MARC.Field object to be of the
    form: [[code,value],...]  This commit makes that true.
    
    Additionally, dojo.filter over a list of lists can cause the
    nested array set to be flattened.  So, instead, we loop directly.

    If users are expected to run all of the 2.2 upgrade scripts, then let's
    make it easy for them. As PostgreSQL 9.1 does not include the \ir
    "include relative path" command, we have to pause at the beginning of
    the upgrade process to ensure that the user is running the script from

    Serials: MFHD::get_compressed_holdings() can reach infinite loop
    
    Even controlled serials holdings involve the internal creation of MFHD
    fields, upon which caculations are performed for such purposes as the
    display of holdings summaries in the OPAC.
    
    There are too many ways that incorrect MFHD (or MFHD that our code just
    can't yet handle) can lead our MFHD routines to crash. We can't address
    all these possibilities in a single bug fix. But we can avoid this
    infinite loop.
    
    A subroutine within open-ils.serial (_summarize_contents()) relies on
    MFHD::get_compressed_holdings(). When the latter went into an infinite
    loop the result would be an open-il.serial drone process consuming CPU
    time indefinitely and, depending on the data that provoked the loop,
    potentially writing repeating messages to stderr indefinitely.
    
    End users will still see the item receiving fail in these cases, and be
    obliged to work around the issue as before until more robust
    holdings summarization code can be written, but at least the overall
    condition of the running Evergreen system won't be affected, and there
    will be better information in the error logs.
