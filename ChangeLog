    Acq general search: improve searching for negative comparisons
    
    This aims to address Launchpad bug #1031535.  I think the bug only
    really shows up when searches involve invoices either as the core type
    or with filter fields.  If a search doesn't involve invoices, the
    problematic joins aren't present.
    
    Could use more testing though.  Seems to make the problem go away, and
    other basic searches seem to work, but I certainly haven't tested
    everything.

    Added a new library setting opac.duplicate_patron_check_use_consortium.
    When true, the duplicate check will use the consortium (1) as the OU.
    When false or not set, the duplicate check will use the workstation OU.
    
    The setting is checked in subroutine that creates the search request and
    sets the OU accordingly.

    Solidify caption/holding relationship, improve MFHD::Holding comparisons
    
    [This commit has been squashed for merging. LFW]
    
      * This commit:
        - Makes sure that holding data is valid for the given caption
          for new holding objects
        - Teaches field_values() to fall back to '*' (unknown marker)
          when a holding is missing data
        - Allows the caption() method to be a setter
    
      * This commit:
        - Makes the comparison operator consider chron data, not just
          enumeration data
        - Teaches the comparison operator a way to handle 'unsure' data
          (that is, data presented in brackets [])
    
      * The code was assuming the $end_holding param would be uncompressed,
        but this was not stated anywhere, nor enforced.  Let's allow the
        method to take both compressed and uncompressed holdings as the "end"
        (and handle it appropriately).
    
      * Add some holdings with missing and unsure data to test the new
        comparison operators handling of such data.

    NOTE: This method is similar to, but much less aggressive/strict than
    get_compressed_holdings(). Ultimately, get_compressed_holdings()
    might be deprecated in favor of this.

    In the case of staging.billing_address_stage_row_id_seq, the

    call was not passing an org unit, and would always fail.
    
    We now pass the home_ou of the user being staged.

    be manually created before its value can be set.
