    Avoid spamming the server with authentication session checks on bad poll

    and avoid integer overflow on long authentication timeout values
    (greater than about 24.8 days) resulting in the poll running with an
    effective timeout of zero and spamming the server with API calls.

    LP#1724029 Patron search API returns correct order
    
    Avoid use of max_chunk_size in patron search API as it results in

    which does not suffer from the sorting issues.  What's more, its purpose
    and affect is easier to grasp in the code.
    
    Bundle count is set to 5 so the API will begin returning results at most
    5 patrons into the data fleshing process.

    LP#1773417 Revamp item and call number tranfers
    
    This commit attempts to achieve the goals of both simplification and
    feature completeness/flexibility.  In brief, limit the number of
    marking and transfer options, then have the code decide the right
    action to take given the circumstances.
    
    There are now just two "marking" actions, one at the record level,
    one at the holdings level.  The holdings level mark will automatically
    mark the destination as specifically as possible from the selected row,
    which means either to the library or call number (vol) level.
    
    We are also now down to two transfer options: transfer the selected
    item, or transfer the selected call number.  Either option will use
    as much given context as possible, then fill in any blanks with
    reasonable defaults and actions.
    
    As part of the change, a number of functions and variables are also
    renamed.  This is all done for clarification, and in most cases is
    due to the variable or function now being used more generally (i.e.
    it is used in both the item and vol context, so it is confusing to
    be named 'volume_transfer_target', etc.).
    
    Finally, clear up a fair bit of now redundant and unused code.

    LP#1773417 Improve empty volume handling
    
    The crux of this patch is to rethink how we handle the volume-only
    editing interface.  Previously, we were attempting to distinguish
    between when the volume was the only thing *showing* and when it
    was actually the only thing *existing*.
    
    We have now removed that distinction, so the volume-only interface
    only cares about the volume regardless of the possible presence of
    a copy.  This simplifies the interface logic, and reduces or
    eliminates the chance of the hidden copy editor interfering with
    the volume adding/editing functions.
    
    Other smaller changes here include:
    - Teach the edit function to pick up copy-less "empty" call numbers
    - Reduce and clarify the arguments to spawnHoldingsAdd
      We had three arguments, but two were simply inversions of one another
      in every case.  Reduce to two arguments and give them more meaningful
      labels
    - Fix typo ("emtpy") preventing proper button disabling for blank call
      numbers
    - Move call number emptiness check from updateLabel() function to value
      watch instead.  This ensure that any updates to that value (even those
      not using the update function) will flip the flag appropriately.  This
      fixes a timing bug which prevented call numbers from being saved
      without further edits in some cases.
    
    Ultimately, as J. Boyer suggests, we would be better off not generating
    the copy editor at all (rather than just hiding it), but we're a few
    steps off from that yet.

    LP#1773417 Relabel "Add Volumes" button
    
    Now that we have an interface for adding empty volumes, we need to be
    more explicit that this button is for adding complete copies, not just
    volumes.

    LP#1715697 Refactor empty volume adding
    
    The new ability to add empty volumes was causing the existing
    ability to add new volume/copy combos to not work as expected.
    More specifically, added volume/copy combos would not generate
    in the selected org_unit, but always in the ws_ou.
    
    To correct this, this change refactors/reverts significant portions of
    920f585052ef809ea6ca1e447d416ada871b467c.  Reasons include:
    
    - Existing code distinguishs 'adds' from 'edits' via two wrappers,
    spawnHoldingsAdd and spawnHoldingsEdit.  With this commit, empty volume
    adding now extends the 'add' function rather than the 'edit' one, as
    this seems more intuitive.
    
    - The previous change had extended both the catalog app and another
    similar directive which is only used in a merging context.  Since the
    merge context had no ability to add anything, and the new code was not
    wired up to the interface, this has simply been removed (for now).
    
    - The volcopy app is set up around the concept of passed in
    'prototype' vol/copy objects of varying degrees of completeness.  It
    then loops over these to generate the interface.  The previous code
    extended this setup with a loop over a potential 'owners' array to
    generate empty volumes, but this unrelated loop within a loop seemed
    counterintuitive (and was the source of the original bug).  This change
    has been removed, and empty volume creation now hews more closely to
    the original model.
    
    While this commit appears large, when viewed in the context of the
    pre-920f58505 code, it is quite limited in scope.

    When the appropriate checkbox is selected, display subordinate libraries of
    the context library that do not have any holdings or empty volumes.
    
    Additionally, the holdings view checkboxes for limiting detail display can
    cause console alerts, and should be made visually interdependent.  This commit
    addresses both of those issues.
