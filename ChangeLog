    LP#1721807: fix webstaff report templates that have might_have and has_many joins
    
    This patch fixes a bug where using a virtual field in the web staff
    report template editor to join another table would result in a syntax
    error in the generated SQL.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch and verify that the regression test in the previous
        commit passes.
    [2] Create new report template in the web staff client that include
        virtual fields and joins and verify that they work. One example
        would be a report that uses ILS User as the base source and joins
        in the patron notes virtual field.
    [3] If available, clone a report template originally created in the web
        staff client that had previously failed, then save it. The new
        report should work.

    This adds an automated regression test as well as some additional
    unit tests for the web staff reporter app and template service.  This
    patch could be applied by itself to verify that the regression
    test (run using 'npm run test' for master or 'grunt test' for rel_3_0)
    fails.

    LP#1746365 Change default staff link colors to provide adequate contrast
    
    The default link color from bootstrap works well on white backgrounds, but
    doesn't provide adequate contrast once the background color is changed.
    This introduces accessbility problems, particularly in cases where linked
    text displays on a selected grid row that uses a light blue background
    color. This change provides a darker default link color.

    LP#1691263: make webstaff MARC editor wrap long fields
    
    This patch makes the MARC editor wrap long fields (e.g.,
    bibliographic 505 fields) so that they fit the width of the enclosing
    window or modal. The approach taken is replacing the text input
    elements with contenteditable divs, which in turn can be better
    styled.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Apply the patch.
    [2] Locate a record with a long 505 field and open it in the
        MARC editor. Verify that the contents of the field wrap.
    [3] Verify that record editing and saving work as expected.

    LP1411422 Copy details repeated in search results when item/volume moved with parts attached
    
    Added the code in perl to respect the existence of parts. Both "transferring volume"
    and "transferring items". "Transferring items" was coded to use
    open-ils.cat.asset.copy.fleshed.batch.update which means most of the work was done in js.
    The web based staff client is coded to use open-ils.cat.transfer_copies_to_volume.
    Decided to use that method for xul as well. Making it more consistent with the "transferring
    volume" code. Considered coding it to move the part level holds to the destination part but
    it's possible that the source part still has items.
