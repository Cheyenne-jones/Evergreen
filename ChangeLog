    LP#16663435 - Stripe org settings lack view permissions.
    
    Unprivileged users can retrieve organizational unit setting values
    for setting types lacking a "view" permission.  When the feature adding
    Stripe credit card processing was added, the upgrade script neglected to
    add the VIEW_CREDIT_CARD_PROCESSING permission to the organizational unit
    setting type (which was included in 0396.data.org-setting-payflowpro.sql).
    
    Fresh installs are not affected, but anyone who upgraded through 0863.data.stripe-payments.sql
    (included in the 2.5.3-2.6.0-upgrade-db.sql version upgrade script) and is
    using Stripe credit card processing should run this script.

    LP 1473054: No-op Checkin Should Not Always Float a Floating Copy.
    
    Prior to this patch, a no-op checkin would not check if a copy should
    float using the evergreen.can_float() function.  It would simply float
    the copy to the org_unit where the checkin happened if the copy had a
    float value set.
    
    This commit changes the behavior to use evergreen.can_float() to
    determine if the copy should float to the org_unit where the checkin
    happened.  This change makes the behavior consistent with a regular
    checkin.

    LP#1653742 Copy tree authoritative API share cstores
    
    Avoid opening one cstore connection per requested org unit in the
    open-ils.cat.asset.copy_tree.retrieve.authoritative API by creating a
    single shared cstore connection at the top of the API shared by all
    API actions.
    
    To test:
    
    1. In one terminal:
    
    % tail osrfsys.log | grep transaction.begin
    
    2. In another terminal:
    
    srfsh% request open-ils.cat
    open-ils.cat.asset.copy_tree.retrieve.authoritative "AUTOTOKEN", 217,
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    
    3. 9 cstore transactions are opened before patching.  After patching,
    only 1 is created.

    LP#1654534: Prevent loop that occurs when staff us 'place another hold' link
    
    A hidden field that tracked the page the user was on before placing a hold was
    inadvertently removed in another bug fix. As a result, if staff used the link
    to place another hold on the same title, they were stuck in a loop where they
    couldn't return to the source page after hitting the 'continue' button. This
    commit restores that hidden field.
    
    Also provides a fix so that hold labels used in the place another hold link
    can be translated.

    LP#1660059: Protect against null value in group field
    
    If a nullable event grouping field is configured, and a null value is indeed
    encountered when pulling together events, the Action/Trigger code will exit
    unceremoniously.  To prevent this, we will now collect events with either
    a null grouping object or grouping field, and use a new batch invalidation
    API call to get rid of them as quickly as possible after group sorting is
    complete.
