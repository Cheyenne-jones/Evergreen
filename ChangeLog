    LP#1208613: Reset lineitem cache when resetting table
    
    Stale cache entries in this table were causing the "expand all"
    functionality to break.  This might be a nuclear option, but as far as
    I could see, this "cache" gets repopulated on every pagination anyway,
    so I don't think we're losing anything.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Select a large list from the Acquisitions --> My Selection List
        screen.
    [2] Click on the Expand All button and the items on the page expand
        with more information.
    [3] Click on the Next link to bring up page 2 of the list.
    [4] Click on the Expand All button and verify that additional
        information is displayed.

    LP#1370694 Selfcheck: "Print List" for Holds view does not work
    
    Prior to this change, the holds data was not getting passed to the
    print function. Now, it is being captured and passed to the print
    function. Because of some sorting discrepancies between the order of
    the information being passed from here to the action trigger and the
    order that the information is presented when pulled directly out of the
    database by the action trigger (which led to data mismatches between the
    title/author and the hold status/pickup locations for each printed item),
    I modified this script to pass all of the hold information together in the
    desired order to the action trigger rather than relying on the template
    to match the data coming from the script with the data from the database.
    
    This change requires the action trigger printing template to be updated in
    order to work. I've included an upgrade script as well as an update to the
    seed data script.

    LP#1551447 Selfcheck: Printing Fines Prints All Open Transactions
    
    This corrects the behavior of the selfcheck fines receipt print template.
    Prior to this, it printed all open billable transactions (eg, every item
    that the patron had checked out) regardless of whether or not it had bills
    associated with it. This adds a small bit of logic to the template to
    check for a balance due. It also updates the javascript to check for a
    balance on the account before launching the print function to prevent the
    system from taking unnecessary action.
    
    This includes a SQL upgrade script to update the Self-Checked Fines
    Receipt template for systems that are already in production, as well as
    including an update to the seed data.

    LP#1454871: Fix KPAC Hold Notification Preferences
    
    Correction to KPAC holds notification default preferences to allow for
    SMS text messaging options.
    
    Prior to this correction, KPAC hold notifications would only pick up
    hold preferences if set to email and/or phone. This correction allows
    it to pick up email and/or phone and/or sms notification preferences.
    
    To test, set hold preferences to different options, place hold via the
    KPAC, and then view the hold to see which preferences were recognized.
    (May need to show columns for Phone Notify, Text Notify, and Email Notify.)

    LP#1548869 KPAC hold results screen not displaying complete info
    
    The getit_results.tt2 page was not displaying item title after
    hold placement or after adding to a list. It was also not pulling
    in the item id (which was needed for navigational links back to the
    record) and was not pulling in the list name after adding an item
    to a named list.
    
    This patch adds some logic to prevent subroutine conflicts, adds
    missing parameters to a function call, and corrects a variable name.
    
    To test:
    
    Log in to the KPAC and perform the following actions:
    
    1. Place a successful hold (results screen should show item title
       and pickup library, and provide links back to record page).
    2. Place an unsuccessful hold (try placing a hold on an item you
       already have a hold on - the results screen should show the item
       title).
    3. Add item to a temporary list (results screen should show item title).
    4. Add item to a named list (results screen should show item title and
       title of list it was added to).

    LP#1549393 - Remove undef values from isbn and issn arrays.
    
    This prevents empty requests being sent to content providers.
    
    This caused a problem for us because invalid ISBNs were causing
    requests to Content Cafe to fail, since Content Cafe returns an
    error if there is a blank key sent along with valid ISBNs and UPCs.
    
    Specifically we had problems with DVD records from Baker & Taylor because
    B&T creates unoffical ISBNs for the DVDs they sell.  Those ISBN's do
    not validate when run through B::ISBN.
    
    ISSNs are also cleaned since they are validated and set to undef if
    invalid just like ISBNs are.
    
    It shouldn't hurt to not send blank requests to providers in any case.
    
    To test:
    1. I know this is a problem with Content Cafe, I don't
    know if any other providers are effected.  Let me know
    if you need Content Cafe credentials to test.
    
    2. Add an invalid ISBN 020a entry to a bib record that has added content.
    9786316271976 is an example of a fake ISBN that doesn't
    pass B::ISBN validation.  Or just make up a fake number.
    
    3. Clear out the memcache entries for that record.  In 2.9+ there
    is a link to clear the cache in the record detail view under Permalink.
    
    4. Reload the record and the cover art and other added content should
    not be displayed.  This is because the invalid ISBN gets set to undef
    , and the undef gets sent to content cafe as a blank key request.
    
    5. Now apply the fix.  Clear the memcache entries for that bib, and now
    the cover art should be displayed since the undef entries due to the invalid
    ISBN's have been removed.

    LP#1550495 - Add EDI Cancel Code 85 - used by Baker & Taylor
    
    Baker & Taylor send back a quantity code 85 response when they cancel
    a line item.  This code wasn't included as one of the built in EDI
    codes so those line items were not being canceled automatically in
    evergreen.
    
    The system looks for the response code + 1200 to find the cancel reason,
    so this code is entered as ID 1285 in the acq.cancel_reason table.
    
    I received confirmation from another system that uses B&T as an EDI vendor
    that they also receive code 85 responses when something gets canceled.

    The fix for bug 1513554 included creating a general trigger function to prevent
    the deletion of reserved table rows with an ID lower than a specified threshold.
    Testing for that seemed to pass muster, but using the function in practice revealed
    a failure to delete deletable rows either.
    
    This adds an explicit RETURN to the function, which fixes the issue.

    LP#1491571: Ignore Case when Checking PW Reset email
    
    Emails are not passwords and are not case sensitive;
    while it is a good idea to require patrons to prove
    they know the address associated with their account
    it is not cool to deny them because they don't know
    the capitalization of the value in the database.

    LP#1206936 - Fix wrong billing info in money.transaction_billing_summary
    
    The money.transaction_billing_summary view was showing the wrong
    last billing type and last billing note for certain transactions.
    This fix, from Dan Scott, in turn from Mike Rylander, recreates
    that view so that it depends on the speedier and more accurate
    money.materialized_billable_xact_summary view.

    LP#1526546 Sort copies by part label in holdings maint.
    
    This commit improves the sorting of copies on the Holdings Maintenance
    screen in the XUL-based staff client. The previous code sorted the
    copies by their barcodes after retrieval. This commit moves the sorting
    logic into the search call and adds logic to first sort by the part
    label sort key.

    LP#1466990: Detailed search results shows parts for items that dont have parts
    
    The part_label variable needs to be reset between iterations. The variable was still set
    and bled from copy to copy. Testing this will require a search with details turned on.
    The search result set needs to include a bib that has copies with parts (with at least
    one copy invisible) and another bib that has copies without parts.
