    LP#1584801: fix tagging of previous circs in metarecord search results
    
    This patch fixes a bug where previously-checked-out items were not
    indicated as such in search results when doing a metarecord search.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Ensure that the opac.search.tag_circulated_items library setting
        is enabled and that you are testing with a user that has opted-in
        to retaining circ history.
    [2] Make a couple loans to that user.
    [3] Log into the public catalog using that user.
    [4] Perform a catalog search, choosing search terms such that
        the previously-loaned items appear in results.
    [5] Verify that "I have checked this item out before" is displayed
        on the relevant hits.
    [6] Click the "Group Formats and Editions" checkbox; note that
        after the page refreshes, previously-borrowed hits are /not/
        tagged.
    [7] Apply the patch and restart the open-ils.search service.
    [8] Repeat step 6; verify that this time previously-borrowed hits
        are tagged.

    LP1567514 - Don't Output Null Byte for Spool Files
    
    If a spool file is defined on the marc_stream_importer.pl
    command line, no null byte is output after the record(s)
    are processed.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Use marc_stream_importer.pl to import a record from
        a file; verify that the output messages do not include
        a null character.

    LP#1517556 - Exclude inactive event defs from find_event_def_by_hook.
    
    Currently when find_event_def_by_hook is called to find an appropriate
    event_def based on the hook, it doesn't exclude inactive event defs.  So
    strange behavior can happen if inactive event defs are present.
    
    I ran into this issue when I was trying out different versions of the self
    check receipt event def.  I had one ative and one inactive while I was
    troubleshooting, and when the system would grab the inactive event def by
    chance, the self check UI would freeze.  I think it is a resonable expectation
    that an event def marked inactive doesn't get used by the system.
    
    To test this out, clone one of the self check event defs, such as
    "Self-Checkout Items Out Receipt" and mark the copy as inactive.  Now
    go and trigger this event in the self check interface by attempting to
    print from the Items Out screen.  It should now fail 50% of the time, since
    both the active and inactive defs are returned.
    
    After the fix the inactive event def will always be excluded, so the action
    should no longer fail.
