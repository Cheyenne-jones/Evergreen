    Rejigger 2.4.3-2.5.0 upgrade bits
    
    As reported in LP#1261355, Postgres fails in some cases when changing
    constraints on existing data inside a transaction.  This may or may not
    fix the actual problem, but it at least tidies up these changes, and
    will make it much cleaner to move outside the transaction if needed.

    Changes to smooth out make_release
    
    1) Make the fake 'HeadURL' into a URL which works with our web repo.
    Note that this has 'tags/' hardcoded in, so it only works with true
    release branches (e.g. rel_x_y_z) not "working" branches
    (e.g. rel_x_y).
    
    2) Change range selector when building log to better exclude commits
    from previous releases.

    Fix proximity adjustment calculator
    
    The canonical use case for proximity adjustment is to use it broadly
    to effect the local proximity of items within a particular area, in
    a like manner, across many parts of the org tree.  However, in cases
    where it is lightly used, or used with non-overlapping criteria columns,
    there are cases where the adjustment will spread beyond its intended
    range of influence.
    
    The changes here create a much stricter and correct test for rule
    matching, which will end in the correct choice of rules in all cases.

    In prereq installer, don't try to chown extracted files to original UID/GID
    
    As this Makefile is designed to be used by a make process running as
    root, this will avoid problems on some systems when tar extracts
    files and tries to give them the same UID/GID as they have in their
    archives, but those accounts don't exist on the local system.
    
    e.g, libdbi has files set 1000/1000. On most systems, there's a user
    and a group with these IDs, but there can be systems where nothing
    uses those IDs, and where tar fails with e.g. 'tar: libdbi-0.8.3:
    Cannot change ownership to uid 1000, gid 1000: Invalid argument'

    LP#1234201: fix menu item to display patron requests (if summary is horizontal)
    
    This patch adds a missing command element to the horizontal
    patron summary display so that the 'Acquisition Requests' menu
    item will work.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Set the Patron circulation summary is horizontal library setting
        to true.
    [2] Retrieve a patron and try using the Acquisition Requests menu
        item.  It will do nothing.
    [3] Apply the patch and clear cache in the staff client.
    [4] Repeat step 2.  This time, the Acquisitions Request menu item
        should bring up the list of the patron's requests.

    LP#1269042: prevent acq seach from building dropdown of every copy ID in the DB
    
    This patch ensures that if a user sets a search field in the
    acquisitions general search form to the line item details copy ID
    (labeled "LID - Evergreen Copy ID"), the form presents a normal
    input widget rather than trying to build a drop-down containing
    every copy ID in the database.  Except for very small databases,
    the previous behavior would mean that an open-ils.pcrud backend
    would eventually consume a great deal of memory trying to service
    a request for all copies in the system.

    Treat empty username as invalid in user editor
    
    There seems to be undesired interaction between the required
    attribute and the isValid method on a dojo/dijit ValidationTextBox.
    If both are set, isValid needs to check for an empty value,
    otherwise the field is considered valid the moment it gains focus.
    
    We don't want an empty username to be considered valid, because we
    know that we will be unable to save the user.
    
    We can work around this by teaching the isValid function to consider
    an empty value as invalid.

    LP#1254816: prevent cases where a Google Book preview is not displayed
    
    Due to quirks in how different parts of the Google Books API
    processes ISBN searches, it is possible for a Google Books Preview
    badge to get displayed, but when the user tries to display the preview,
    the embedded preview does not get displayed.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by grabbing the preview link from
    the GB volumes search results, which in turn can be fed into the
    Embedded Viewer initialization.
    
    An ISBN that can be used to reproduce the problem is 9781937994198.
    Before the patch, the badge is displayed but not the preview; after
    the patch, both badge and preview should be displayed.

commit 37eff510e374360640bec86ee3be00eda28ffb0b
Author: Steven Chan <schan@sitka.bclibraries.ca>
Date:   Wed May 15 14:30:15 2013 -0700

    Fix LP1180140, View Holds not working for a serial with subscription and no issuances
    
    A request is made to
    open-ils.circ.holds.retrieve_all_from_title,
    which is the function Circ/Holds.pm/all_rec_holds().
    
    In the function, when checking for issuance holds, there is a missing @
    to dereference the list of issuance IDs, so that the ahr table is search
    with badly formed input, which results in returning an undefined list
    instead of an empty list.  The error will occur for any record with a
    serial.subscription entry but with no related entries in
    serial.issuance.
    
    We also recode the initialization of the response object in order to
    clarify its expected structure, a hash of array references.

    Always show Email Address label to staff
    
    When placing holds staff commonly change out patrons, and pointing staff
    towards the "My Account" area makes no sense to begin with.

    Docs: integrate holds docs from EG 2.1
    
    The small amount of Holds docs present in master seemed to fit well at
    the end of the older Holds documentation, so this commit appends them
    to the new holds.txt file, deletes the previous holds_management.txt file,
    and makes the appropriate change to root.txt.
    
    This commit also includes several small formatting improvements, wording
    changes, and bug fixes.
