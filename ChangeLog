    These were in the repository from the testing phase of 2.3-2.4 during the
    2.4 alpha/RC period. These script are not required and may be confusing if
    run. Remove as unnecessary.

    LP#902255: Correct "ILS Event at check in" logic
    
    In a classic case of "fix a bug to reveal another" it turn out that
    there was a small logic bug hiding in the check in hold-capture code.
    The result of this bug was that the wrong ILS Event object was being
    returned when we ran into the double-scan hold-capture situation by
    overwriting the correct one immediately after we construct it, which
    in turn prevented the previous commit from working as designed.
    
    We now return the correct ILS Event immediately so that we can
    properly detect the situation.  Two birds with one branch.

    LP#902255: Protect against hold double-capture
    
    When the staff client is in Fast Scan (async) mode, it is possible
    to double-scan at checkin and cause two holds to be captured by the
    same item.  By creating a specially crafted unique index we ensure
    that the database rejects this situation.
    
    This protection would cause unhandled errors in the staff client, so
    we also register a new string to be displayed when this particular
    situation occurs, alerting staff to the possible double-scan of a
    barcode at checkin IFF they are using async mode.

    LP#1365661 Found patrons with same name not opening
    
    This patch fixes the error, while registering a new patron
    and clicking the link "Found {$0} patron(s) with the same
    name" did not previously work in the staff client.
    
    To reproduce the bug, register a new patron with the name of an
    existing patron.  The little widget with the message described
    above will appear.  The message is a hyperlink, but nothing
    appears to happen if you click it.  The JavaScript console will
    contain an error ReferenceError:js2JSON is not defined.
    
    After applying this patch, clicking the hyperlink does a search
    for matching patrons as intended.  The ReferenceError also
    disappears.

    LP#1154656 MARC Expert Search "Add Rows" adds duplicate row
    
    This patch changes the behavior of the "Add Search Row" link
    (JavaScript function from simple.js "addExpertRow()") so that
    we are always cloning the initial "empty" row instead of
    potentially cloning a row -- by way of cloneNode() -- with user
    input in place, and causing duplicate search rows.
    
    To reproduce the bug, go to Advanced Search, fill in all three
    search fields with some text, click on Add Search Row.  You wil
    see that the Title search row along with the data in the text
    box is duplicated and added to the search.
    
    After this patch, the new row should be added with an empty
    text box.

    LP#1463973: Use dollar-quoting for report literals
    
    When inserting string literal into SQL for Clark, we quote
    apostrophes with a backslash.  That worked fine until Postgres
    changed its default for the standard_conforming_strings GUC to "on"
    after which it no longer worked fine.
    
    So, we will now use "dollar quoting" for string literals instead
    in much the same way we do for our search queries.
    
    Test plan
    ---------
    
    Pre-patch: Try to run a report where a string value is required as
    a filter parameter, and include an apostrophe in that string.  The
    report will fail with an SQL error.
    
    Post-patch: Do the same, it will not fail.

    LP#1403966: Remove publication-specific information from metarecord results page
    
    The records that make up a matarecord search result typically contain different
    publication information. Therefore, we should remove the master record's
    specific publication information from that search results page.
    
    Test plan
    Prior to loading the patch, conduct a search on the Concerto dataset
    for "brahms piano concerto no. 1" with "Group Formats and Editions" turned on.
    In the brief view, you will see a call number and, in the more details view, you
    will see publisher and physical description information. Run the same search
    after loading the patch, and you will no longer see that information.

    to just return the raw code of that script since it uses mod cgi.

    The ACQ lineitem audit table was augmented with an fkey pointing

    LP#1449283: fix auth when running under Apache 2.4
    
    When running under Apache 2.4 using the stock configuration
    derived from apache_24/eg_vhost.conf.in, protected
    URLs such as https://eghost/reporter/ that are meant to
    require valid EG staff credentials were not in fact
    requiring authentication.
    
    This patch does the following to fix this:
    
    [1] Removes several uses of "Require all granted" that
        was causing authentication to be ignored.
    [2] Changes OpenILS::WWW::Proxy::Authen so that it always
        sets the username in the Apache request object if
        authentication was successful; it appears that starting
        with Apache 2.4, authentication handlers must ensure
        that a user name is set for a "Require valid-user"
        directive to work.
