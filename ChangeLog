	* Enable truncation attribute in Z39.50 queries to be left out
	  entirely
	  
	  Per https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/702695, some Z39.50
	  servers hate the truncation attribute (@attr 5=anything) and
	  always
	  return 0 hits.
	  
	  This gives you the ability to specify a negative value for the
	  truncation attribute and thereby prevent the truncation attribute
	  from being included in the Z39.50 query for a given server.

	* Build and flatten a tree, correcting a sorting issue in some OU
	  dropdowns.
	  
	  The previous code assumed that work org units would be delivered
	  in hierarchical order, but alas, they are not. Thus, we build the
	  hierarchy and then flatten it, sorting at each level.
	  This will be non-fast with many work OUs, but the common case is
	  a small set, which is not painful.
	  
	  Further improvement is warranted when the above proves false.

	* some interfaces (or at least org_unit_settings.js) was not
	  infering the identifier value here. This helps the filtering org
	  select dijit in that interface
