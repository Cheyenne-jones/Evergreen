    LP#1771422 Reset transiting hold copy status fix
    
    Avoid modifying the copy status in the hold-reset API when it's passing
    the copy off to the transit API for canceling the transit.  Let the
    transit API handle the status instead.
    
    This fixes a bug where resetting a transiting hold, and canceling its
    transit, would leave the targeted copy in "in transit" status instead of
    "canceled transit".

    LP#1752753: Guard against invalid timezone
    
    If the lib.timezone org setting is not a valid timezone, attempting to
    use it can result in an internal server error in the OPAC.  Let's handle
    the error with try/catch instead.
    
    To test
    -------
    1. In Library Settings Editor, edit the "Library time zone" setting for
       Example Branch 1, setting the value to something that's not the name
       of a time zone (like "invalid" or "UTC-07:00").
    2. In the OPAC, retrieve a record with holdings at Example Branch 1.
        You will get an Internal Server Error.
    3. Edit the library setting to use a valid timezone name, like
       "America/Vancouver".
    4. Retrieve the same record again. This time, the record will display
       properly.
    5. Apply the patch and repeat steps 1 and 2; this time, there should
       be no internal server error.

    LP#1746815: Fix sticky hold url param
    
    Renamed the hold_id url param from "id" to "hid" and prevent it from
    sticking in url's where it not needed.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Log in to the public catalog as a patron that has at least
        two hold requests.
    [2] Go to the My Account holds tab and edit one of the holds.
    [3] Rather than submit a change, click on the holds tab again.
    [4] Note that /only/ the hold you were edit displays, and that the
        'id' URL parameter persists as you navigate through the public
        catalog.
    [5] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-3. This time, you should
        see all of the holds.

    When displaying the Holdings View tab for a bib in the web staff client,
    if a volume record has no copies, a Javascript error gets thrown.
    
    Item-less volumes still end up in svc.copies at this point, so at the
    moment it is necessary to check whether copy_alerts actually exists.
    Some renaming might also be in order to clarify that svc.copies doesn't
    necessarily contain /only/ fleshed acp records.

    LP#1755220: Return value checking in offline session fetch
    
    We need to make sure that we receive the correct shape of data (array) rather
    than that we simply got anything when fetching sessions.  In the case of an
    expired session token, we'll receive an ILS Event object informing us of the
    expiration where we'd normally see a list of sessions.

    LP#1745240: Hold Alias Missing from Hold Shelf Slip
    
    A patron's hold alias can be printed in the hold shelf slip using the variable patron.alias.  This patch just adds 'patron.alias' to the list of available options displayed at the top of the template. Also adds a colon before the patron's name fields for consistency.

    LP#1745232 - Bill History Receipt doesn't have Finish Date
    
    Adds xact.finish and xact.summary.last_payment to the example data.  Also adds xact.summary.last_payment_ts to the template body to indicate when the last payment was made.  Also adds a list of variables that can be used in the template in the template's description.
    
    To test -
    1. apply the patch
    2. find a patron with billings, or add some billings to a patron record.
    3. make payments on some of the billings using various methods.
    4. go to billing history and print the history list.

    LP#1765444: improve how MARC editor fetches fixed field metadata
    
    This patch fixes a problem where the web staff MARC editor would
    make repeated and redundant calls to two Evergreen methods to fetch
    data about fixed field positions and values if that metadata was
    not already cached by local storage or Hatch.
    
    In particular, this patch caches and returns the data retrieval
    promises, ensuring that only one set of FF position and value
    requests are made.
    
    Prior to this patch, each eg-marc-edit-fixed-field directive, of which
    there are 64, could end up invoking those methods when initializing
    the editor for a record type that had not been previously seen.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Clear all FFPosTable_* and FFValueTable_* keys from local storage
        (or Hatch).
    [2] Retrieve a bib record in the web staff client. Note that up to
        64 calls each are made of open-ils.cat.biblio.fixed_field_values.by_rec_type
        and open-ils.fielder.cmfpm.atomic.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat steps #1 and #2.
    [4] This time, note that only one call each are made.
    [5] Verify that the fixed field inputs continue to work as expected.

    Adds a test to see if there is a value in Payment Received input box. The
    Apply Payment button doesn't activate unless a billing or billings is
    selected and a numerical value is in Payment Received.
    
    To test.
    1. Add some billings to a patron's account.
    2. Click some of the billings to select them. Notice that the Apply Payment
       button is active.
    3. Apply patch
    4. Select some of the billings.  The Apply Payment button is not active.
    5. Enter some values into Payment Received.  If values other than numbers
       are entered the Apply Payment button is not activated.  If numbers are
       added the button is activated.
    6. Uncheck all of the billings to see that the activated button deactivates,
       if no billings are checked.

    [1] Select the top of your permission group tree (Users, likely) and
        search again, results should be the same.
    [2] Select a group further down the tree (Circulators, Administrators,
        Patrons, etc.) and repeat the search, there should only be results
        from that group and its descendants.
    [3] Finally, select a group with no child groups. Results will only be
        that specific group.

    LP#1756912: restore display of copy counts for preferred library
    
    This patch fixes a regression introduced by the patches for bug 1698206
    and restores the display of copy counts for the preferred library (when set)
    on the public catalog results and record details pages.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Log into the public catalog as a user and set a preferred library.
    [2] Perform a catalog search at a system that is other than the
        preferred library set in step 1. Repeat the search with
        "Groups Formats and Editions" checked.
    [3] Note that in both cases, the copy counts displayed in search results and
        the record details pages do not include a line for the preferred
        library.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat step 2. This time, the preferred library
        count should be included in the display.
    
    The substance of this patch (with the exception of the pgTAP tests)
    follows an approach suggested by Bob Wicksall <bwicksall@pls-net.org>

    LP#1740537 Transit dialog showing wrong branch
    
    Always retrieve the latest copy transit from the server when displaying
    the copy transit dialog.  This resolves an issue where a just-closed
    transit is used instead.
    
    Add a filter to avoid canceled transits.
    
    Make the transit lookup call authoritative, since the transit may have
    just been created.
    
    To test (test plan courtesy of John Amundson):
    
    1. Sign in as Library A.
    2. Check in an item owned by Library B that does not have any holds
       associated with it. This will send the item in transit to its home,
       Library B.
    3. Place a hold on the item to be picked up at Library C.
    4. Sign in as Library B.
    5. Check in the item. The transit pop-up and printout will show that
       the item needs to be transited to Library B instead of Library C.
    6. Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-5 using a different item. This
       time, the transit pop-up will show that the item needs
       to be transited to Library C.

    LP#1765501: ensure that webstaff MARC editor can deal with short 008s
    
    This patch ensures that the 008 field, when maintained by the web staff
    MARC editor, is kept at its proper length. In particular, this solves a
    problem where input can get messed up if the user selects the entire
    contents of the 008 field and replaces it with a shorter string.
    
    To test
    ------
    [1] Create a new bib record. Ensure that the MARC record editor is
        /not/ in flat text mode.
    [2] Edit the 008 field by selecting its entire contents and replacing it
        with a subset. For example, this might be done when the first action
        that a cataloger takes is to set the 008/00-05.
    [3] Enter value in the individual fixed-field inputs at the top of the
        MARC editor form. For example, enter 'eng' in the Lang field.
    [4] Note that the results are wrong; e.g., the text ends up as
        "080419en en eng".
    [5] Apply the patch and repeat steps #1-#4. This time, the results
        should be correct.

    When suggested call numbers are pulled from a bib record, space delimiters are

    a space between subfield values.
    
    Also included are two small optimizations: exit early if no nodes are found
    for a particular bib CN definition; use map+join instead of a for loop and
    blind substring trim to stitch together an xpath expression.

    LP#1732591: (follow-up) fix major regressions
    
    This patch works around two regressions introduced by a previous patch:
    
    - record links from titles on the OPAC results page simply re-ran
      the search
    - record links from cover images on the OPAC results page dropped
      all paramters
    
    In one case, a 'record_url' should have been a mkurl() expression. In the
    other case, the prior patch did not handle the clear_params parameter
    correctly; an empty array is /not/ equivalent to undef, and all CGI parameters
    were getting cleared.
    
    This patch is offered in lieu of simply pushing a revert.

    LP#1748006 Patron edit juv flag manual override
    
    Allow staff to manually override the patron juvenile flag value
    regardless of patron DoB.
    
    Patch removes the ng-blur handler for dob and expire_date, which fires
    too aggressively.  The dob handler is replaced with a $watch handler, so
    the new and old value can be compared.  No watch is applied to
    expire_date, since no code is currently fired when it's changed.
    
    Change the log level of the "field changed" message from log to debug.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Open a patron in the web staff patron editor.
    [2] Apply a juvenile birth date (less than 18 years by default).
    [3] Confirm the juvenile flag is automatically activated (if it wasn't
        already).
    [4] Confirm it's possible to un-check the juvenile flag and save the
        patron.

    Always retrieve display field data, and decide whether to use the highlighted

    LP173259 - Array error appears in search box while placing hold after advanced search
    
    The place-hold code assumed it was not in "_adv" parameter mode.  This
    assumption was faulty.  Now, the link generated for Place Hold will
    translate the argument list to the single-line format that Place Hold
    expected, when necessary.
    
    Testing procedure:
    
    Set holds for all the following items, observing that the searchbox in
    the searchbar is not blank and does not contain ARRAY(xxx).
    
    Basic Search / Place Hold
    Basic Search / Record Detail / Place Hold
    Advanced Search with a plain search term / Place Hold

    LP#1738249: sort out circ or renewal workstation
    
    This patch uses accs to work out the name of the workstation
    of the most recent renewal, if it exists, or the original
    checkout. It implicitly handles the case where the workstation
    on the original circulation is null.  As a bonus, this patch
    adds an explicit "Last Renewal Workstation" to the item status
    grid.

    LP#1746300: Fix circulation counts in Item Status Details
    
    Currently, the "Total Circs -Current Year" and "Total Circs -
    Prev Year" numbers are seemingly randomly incorrect.  This is
    caused by pulling the numbers from the "circbyyr" fieldmapper
    object, which results in an array of 2 rows (one for renewals
    and one for new circs).  The current JS only displays the count
    for the first item in the array, ignoring the other.
    
    This branch totals the two, resulting in the right result for each
    year's circulations.

    LP#1758360: handle DOB display logic in egPatronSummary correctly
    
    This patch ensures that the patron DOB will be displayed or
    obscured correctly by the standalone egPatronSummary directive
    in the same way that the patron app does.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] In the web staff client, do a patron search, select two patrons,
        then click the Merge Patrons button.
    [2] Note that the patron DOB is not displayed in the modal.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step #1.
    [4] This time, the patron DOB will be displayed (if the
        circ.obscure_dob library setting is not enabled) or the
        the field label will be clickable (and clicking it will
        cause the DOB to be displayed).

        this works as expected & receivable issues are listed.

        Example enter "109242427" results in two errors.
    
    [3] Desired behavior - If you enter a database ID or ISSN in the
        "Enter an identifier for a bibliographic record" field the
        receivable issuances should be displayed

    LP#1739044: fix lock file detection in eg-pbx-allocator.pl
    
    Lock file detection wasn't working correctly.  The
    wrong operator was used to read the contents of the lock file.
    
    Testing:
    
    Running the eg-pbx-allocator.pl in the background multiple times will
    trigger the lock file detection.  Use -t to run in test mode to avoid
    moving any files while testing.
    
    /usr/local/bin/eg-pbx-allocator.pl -t -v -c /usr/local/etc/eg-pbx-daemon.conf &
    /usr/local/bin/eg-pbx-allocator.pl -t -v -c /usr/local/etc/eg-pbx-daemon.conf
    
    In syslog you can see entries that are missing the PID number when you test
    before the fix is installed.
    
    virt-asterisk1 eg-pbx-allocator.pl: lock file present (/tmp/eg-pbx-allocator-LOCK),  still running
    
    after the fix is installed, you will see the PID in the syslog entry.

    LP#1760223: Update HTTP headers to follow standard
    
    In the olden days, some browsers didn't understand the "attachment" content
    disposition.  They only understood "inline" but would let the user save a file
    if a filename was provided.  However, in these modern days, relevant browsers
    all do the right thing and know about both flavors of content disposition, so
    we, too, must change with the times and support the letter of the standard.
