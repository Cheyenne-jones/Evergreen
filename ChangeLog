    LP#968514: Revive bib/auth importing docs from 2.1, add intro
    
    This commit revives the following sections from the 2.1 version of the docs
    and updates them for 2.6:
    
      - marc_export: Exporting Bibliographic Records into MARC files
        - includes new options for 2.6
      - Importing Authority Records from Command Line
      - Importing Authority Records from the Staff Client
    
    The first two are included in a new section called "Support Scripts"
    within the "Developer Resources" section, with a new intro and summary
    of other commonly used scripts provided with Evergreen. The third section
    is moved inside the Cataloging chapter "Batch Importing MARC Records",
    with slight modifications to the intro to that chapter.

    LP#925776: Recheck located uri visibility
    
    Previous to this commit, once we have determined that there are no
    local Located URIs or foreign copies, we include the record in the
    result set in the staff client.  However, the desire of library staff
    is that foreign Located URIs be valid as a visibility limiter.  So
    we now recheck at the end for that situation.  This honors the new
    "Located URIs act like copies" global flag.

    LP#1326983: excluded fulfilled holds when adding hold_request.shelf_expires_soon events
    
    This patch adjusts the example A/T filter for the
    hold_request.shelf_expires_soon hook to exclude hold requests that are
    already marked as fulfilled.  This saves time creating events that
    would immediately be marked as invalid per the HoldIsAvailable
    validator.
    
    It also addresses an issue for large databases that have lots of
    fulfilled holds wherein hold_request.shelf_expires_soon events can
    fail to be added at all due to a cstore timeout.
