	serials display (under the "issues held" label) (All the following text assumes you're using "new" 2.0+ serials and
	that the org unit setting 'opac.fully_compressed_serial_holdings' is
	true in the context where you're browsing.) Today on the TPAC record detail page under the "issues held" label,
	you get a list of serial summary statements, which you can expand to
	a list of issuances for which items have been received.  You can
	place issuance-level holds on these.  That existing interface just kind of burps up all your holdings
	within scope and doesn't show you what holdings belong to what org
	unit.  Furthermore, it doesn't group your holdings into enumeration
	or chronology units, which can matter a lot if you've got 150 years
	of some daily newspaper and you're trying to browse through them in
	the OPAC.  This new interface presents expanded serials holdings organized into
	a tree, with summaries placed under their org units and holdings
	grouped under their summaries under either chronology units
	(default) or enumeration ones, controlled by a new field on
	serial.distribution.  There's also a new org unit setting that lets
	you change the default value for this new field in the Alternate
	Serial Control view to enumeration, if you want.  Like the issues-held interface it's replacing, this knows how to
	deal with holdings where you have one unit per received item, or no
	units per received item, but its behavior is not yet defined for one
	unit per many items (the binding case).  The "regular" Serial
	Control view doesn't have a widget to control the new field on
	serial.distribution yet.  These are the areas where I'd be
	interested in helping to close the gaps, before or after this is
	committed.   Conflicts: 	Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/EGCatLoader/Record.pm 	Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/EGCatLoader/Util.pm 	Open-ILS/web/css/skin/default/opac/style.css

	commit.  This is the first new feature (as far as I know) to take advantage
	of PCRUD fleshing. Very briefly, imagine issuing a query to PCRUD
	with lots of arbitrarily deep fleshing, and getting back a set of
	flat rows with the fields you need for display/editing/whatever all
	neatly picked out as if ready to be displayed in a table or
	grid-based UI.  FlattenerGrid, which knows how to use this, can potentially replace
	and avoid lots of relatively complex (AutoGrid + custom middle layer
	methods)-powered interfaces.  AutoGrid interfaces that just work

	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Scripts.html
	notes: "building scripts this way has one drawback: directory
	variables such as $(datadir) are not fully expanded and may refer to
	other directory variables".  This was particularly a problem for variables such as @sysconfdir@
	in code that doesn't understand shell syntax - such as
	Cronscript.pm.  This commit moves towards build-time configuration of those
	variables.  We still use *.in files, but mark the built versions as
	dependencies in build recipes such that we can build and test within
	the source directory without having to install the files. We also
	gain the advantage of teaching "make clean" to clean up the built
	versions of the files.

	win_list().  get_tab returns an object with the keys 'name' and 'content',
	pointing to the tab label and the tab panel -> iframe ->
	contentWindow, respectively.  So let's say you had a patron account open in tab 1, and the
	Javascript Shell open in tab 2.  In the shell, you could do:     var o = get_tab(1); o.name might contain something like     1 Patron: Circulator, Ima and you could do this to refresh that interface:     o.content.g.patron.refresh_all()

	order: 1. Search library proximity 2. Search library name 3. (Search results only) Call number, by most available copy status 4. Call number label 5. Copy status availability Also return & display the copy counts ("x of y copies are
	available") for the search library and each of its parents.  We can also determine "preferred library" as follows, taking the
	first match: 1. A new GET param, "plib", specifying the number of the OU 2. If authenticated, the user's "search library" preference setting; 3. If authenticated, the user's home library; 4. Physical location in which the search is being issued (if any) Given a preferred library: 1. Promote the copies (if any) for the preferred library to the top
	   of the copy display list.  2. Include the copy count for the preferred library if it is outside
	   of the scope of the search library; 3. In record details, give users the ability to jump to their
	   preferred library scope via "Show preferred library" beside the
	   preferred library copy count, if applicable. If your search library
	   is located beneath your pref library in the org hierarchy, then
	   you'll get just the "copy depth" link instead.  Also, untangle the located URIs from physical call numbers in
	in-database unapi.  We had been facing the limitation of URIs being limited by the
	maximum number of call numbers, with the result that URIs may or may
	not have been displayed. Now, we take the bold tack of returning all
	URIs that are in scope for both the search library and the preferred
	library. No limiting is currently possible, but in the realistic
	worst case scenario of both search lib and pref lib being set to an
	OU at depth 4, we'll get a maximum of 8 different URIs back to
	display. (More realistically, it's unlikely that a different URI
	will be set for each level of the hierarchy.) Some of the more granular code changes are as follows: * Add attributes to in-db unapi acp, sunit, holdings_xml This gives us more flexibility in displaying due dates within search
	results or other contexts in which holdings are displayed. The
	age_protect, copy_id, and vol_id attributes are required by the
	record summary display.  * Enable TPAC to display records via HSTORE-based unapi Now that unapi requires HSTORE-based LIMIT and OFFSET arguments,
	take the simplest possible approach to get get_records_and_facets()
	working again.  In search results, we want to limit both the number of copies we get
	back (defaulting to a maximum of 5 copies per call number) and the
	number of call numbers we get back (defaulting to a maximum of 5
	call numbers), so that we don't get 50 call numbers each with 5
	copies back and wind up grinding Evergreen's performance down to a
	halt.  Rough thought is that the caller can filter through the (maximum) 25
	hits that are returned to present their preferred results. For
	example, a site could opt to show 5 different call numbers with just
	one copy per call number, or 5 different copies for a single call
	number, or all 25.  * Avoid deleted call numbers, copies, and sunits The rewrite of unapi removed the filters for deleted call numbers
	that were added to master in LP# 893315 / commit hash 47a16f516d.
	Fix this to prevent returning pages of results that would show
	nothing in the TPAC because all of the call numbers were deleted.  * Display multiple URIs correctly We weren't clearing the hash each time that we added it to the list
	of URIs, and that ended up duplicating the URI rather than adding
	distinct URIs.  * Take copy availability into account for copy order This is most important in the LIMITed list of copies returned to the
	TPAC search results page, but also useful on the record details
	page.  This commit adds "copy status ranking" into the result ordering,
	such that more available copies will be returned first in the list
	(and thus, in the case of search results where call numbers and
	copies are typically limited (currently to 5 of 5), ensuring that
	the most available copies are likely to be seen by users).  The "availability" ranking for a copy is defined by a new function,
	evergreen.rank_cp_status(), that takes criteria from the
	config.copy_status table and ranks it in three tiers, as follows: 1. Most available =  opac_visible and copy_active are both TRUE 2. Almost available = holdable and opac_visible are TRUE, but    copy_active is FALSE, or status ID = 1 ("Checked out") 3. Unavailable = anything else.  Thus, changing copy availability ranking (such as demoting "On holds
	shelf" from the "most available" status to "almost available"), is
	simply a matter of tweaking the evergreen.rank_cp_status() function.  * unapi database functions: mark STABLE Thomas Berezansky suggested marking one of the new database
	functions in the in-database unapi suite as STABLE to help the
	optimizer, which lead to us realizing that everything can be marked
	as stable. This should enable the planner to generate better plans
	than if left to the default pessimistic level of VOLATILE.

	updated like so: * Instead of using the reporter tables, bib data is fetched and
	extracted via unapi, which allows access to SVF data (etc) and is
	more consistent with the tpac.  * A number of unused A/T evnironment entries for the seed templates
	were removed.  * The delay for the email template was explicitly set to 00:00:00
	instead of the default 5 minutes to get the emails out quicker.

	long.  This code was developed in fits over time, and it had to be
	disentangled from some site-specific configuration and workarounds
	before it could be usefully published.  Enhancements over what's already committed to master include: - a feature that allows an Evergreen system to query the PBX (where   PBX here refers to an Asterisk system plus the eg-pbx-* scripts
	  from Evergreen - particularly eg-pbx-mediator.pl) for the A/T
	  event IDs associated with failed notifcations, so that those A/T
	  events can be "rolled over" into new ones with a different event
	  definition, and thus a different notification method - holiday awareness in eg-pbx-allocator (the piece run by cron whose   main responsibility is dripping files from a staging directory
	  into Asterisk's real spool for call files).  There's a script
	  (set_pbx_holidays) that can be run by cron on an Evergreen system to
	  periodically update the PBX's table of holidays based on a given org
	unit's closed_date ranges.  - smart retry.  In certain situations, if you put too many callfiles   into Asterisk's spool at once, Asterisk will try to make too many   calls at once, and all such calls just fail.  That's what the   allocator is meant to prevent.  Smart retry is about moving calls
	  that have been tried once, and will be retried again later due to
	  resulting in a busy signal or other problem, out of the spool to
	  make room for other calls that could be made in the mean time.  - miscellaneous helper scripts and tricks for spreading more   reportable/greppable information among A/T output and cleaning up   callfiles that result in no-op's for Asterisk. Lock file checking
	  for the allocator. Etc.  I also have tried to throw in some useful documentation.  I admit
	things look a bit jumbled, but I'll be as available as I can make
	myself to help anyone who steps up to clarify documentation or
	improve code in order to make general adoption of these features a
	little easier.

	descriptors as returned by
	open-ils.search.metabib.record_to_descriptors), then
	holdArgs.recordDescriptors in holds.js can be an empty array.  There
	is a line of code that assumes this will never happen.  The end user-visible result of the javascript failing here is an
	alert() dialog about phone number format, but this is a red herring.
	That only happens because the problem code is in one big function
	that has too many responsibilites.

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Application/Acq/Order.pm: 
	Acq+Vandelay : more aggressive streamed response throttling With the addition of Vandelay processing, the server now wants to
	respond with status information a lot more often when uploading /
	process ACQ records.  This patch applies the level of throttling to
	ACQ processing as Vandelay uses natively, which starts verbose and
	quickly cuts back on chatter as processing continues up to
	(currently) a throttle window of 1 delivered response per 256
	responses.  Apart from saving bandwith, this helps alleviate a known
	problem in the staff client where long-running, dense streams of
	multipart responses eventually stop bubbling up from the browser to
	the application.  Making the responses more sparse seems to help
	this a lot.

	l: ACQ+Vandelay permission improvements Be more vigilant about enforcing permissions for various ACQ and
	Vandelay actions.  1. Using vandelay to create new bib records now requres the
	IMPORT_MARC permission (same as
	open-ils.cat.biblio.record.xml.import).  If the permission fails,
	the queued record will fail import and be stamped with a new
	"import.record.perm_failure" vandelay import error.  2. Added suport for testing additional permissions before a new
	record is created via vandelay.  This allows interfaces leveraging
	vandelay (e.g. ACQ) to create a higher barrier to entry.  Added an
	ACQ perm IMPORT_ACQ_LINEITEM_BIB_RECORD_UPLOAD that prevents users
	from creating new bib records directly from the ACQ vendor MARC file
	upload interface.  The secondary permission is not meant as a security enhancement, per
	se, since the user is required to have the IMPORT_MARC permission to
	get this far in the process.  It's more of a feature-specific
	precautionary permission to prevent unintended record creation
	within certain permission groups.  3. Checking the CREATE_PURCHASE_ORDER permission during the ACQ
	vendor file upload process.  It's absence appears to have been an
	oversight.

	Open-ILS/src/templates/opac/parts/record/copy_counts.tt2: TPac:
	detail page distinct copy/holdings display depth This adds a new CGI param "copy_depth" which the record detail page
	uses to determine which copies to display in the copy grid and what
	serials holdings data to show.  The goal is to separate search depth from copy display depth for 2
	main reasons: 1. When present, the search ou is set by the "locg" parameter (org +
	copy location group).  The "Show" links in the record detail page
	use "loc" to determine the copy location org (and subsequently the
	depth), which is ignored in the presence of "locg".  In other words,
	we need a different way to communicate which range of copies to
	display.  2. Separating copy depth and search depth allows us to display
	search location-related summary information while at the same time
	displaying a broader set of copy information.  For example,
	searching BR1, we can see copy summary info for BR1, SYS1, and CONS
	even when explicitly viewing copy information for CONS.  In other
	words, viewing a broader set of copies for a record does not change
	the search/context org unit, it only extends the set of copies to
	display.

	selector is used in a search context.  Groups display below the
	owning org unit similar to a child org unit.  Groups are displayed
	for all org units that meet the following criteria:  search org
	unit, physical location, patron home org unit, plus ancestors and
	descendents of each.  To support this, TPac gets a new "locg" CGI parameter, which
	contains the org unit and copy location group.  It takes the form
	org_id:group_id.  The TPac mod_perl code will extract this value and
	popuplate the search_ou accordingly.  For consistency, we also use
	ctx.search_ou instead of directly checking CGI.param('loc') within
	the template environment.  This also includes a rewrite of the org_selector.tt2 template.  It
	changes it from a recursive routine to a depth-first while loop.  I
	did this mainly because the recursive approach was suffering from
	global variable clobbering in the template environment.  In theory,
	this new approach should be faster as well.

	Circulation -> Browse Hold Shelf Circulation -> Pull List for Hold
	Requests The main Print action (from the “Print” button next to the List
	Actions menu) uses the same template, “holds”, for all
	incarnations of the interface.  We will change this behavior in
	holds.js (specifically in the cmd_holds_print method) such that each
	interface variation will use its own template.  The new templates
	will be: holds_on_bib holds_for_patron holds_shelf holds_pull_list We will keep the “holds” template for backwards compatibility
	and as a fallback for when these new templates have not yet been
	configured.  These new templates will be stubbed in data.js (in the
	print_list_defaults method) so that they will appear in the Receipt
	Template Editor, but by default they will not have any defined
	content for their headers, footers, and line items.  Instead, we
	will use a new field called “inherit”, and have each new
	template use “holds” (referring to the original template) as the
	value for their inherit fields.  So, for example, the current default ‘holds’ template is defined
	like this: 'holds' : {   'type' : 'holds',   'header' : 'Welcome to %LIBRARY%!<br/>\r\nYou have the following
	  titles on hold:<hr/><ol>', 'line_item' : '<li>%title%\r\n',   'footer' : '</ol><hr />%SHORTNAME% %TODAY_TRIM%<br/>\r\nYou were
	  helped by %STAFF_FIRSTNAME%<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n' }, The new ‘holds_for_patron’ template will be defined as a peer
	like this: 'holds_for_patron' : {   'type' : 'holds',   'inherit' : 'holds' }, We will modify the _print_tree method in list.js and the post_init
	method in print_list_template_editor.js such that they will react to
	any value in a template’s inherit field and allow it to redirect
	them to use the contents of the inherited template.  For this
	particular use-case, we only need to support one level of
	indirection, but we may opt to support chains of inheritance for
	future use.  We will modify the save_template method in
	print_list_template_editor.js so that the inherit field for a given
	template will be cleared if that specific template is saved,
	breaking the link and associating the displayed (and possibly
	edited) header, footer, and line item with the template.

	which requires a profile of some sort to do anything, to find
	matching records.  This is useful for importing holdings when the
	MARC from the source record is not desired.  It will also be useful
	in the (forthecoming) Vandelay-driven Acquisitions lineitem linking (LP
	pending).  The target/incumbent record is not affected.  2. Full Overlay Used for overlaying an entire inbound MARC record over its target
	record.  The target/incumbent record is completely replaced by the
	inbound record.  For both, 901c is used because it's automatically updated on the
	target record to match the internal ID, regardless of any field
	preservation/stripping.

	Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/vandelay/vandelay.js: Vandelay: refresh
	upload and inspect queue pages Vandley sub-pages are currently managed as hidden divs that come
	into view when the requested tab is selected.  This creates two
	types of problems in the interface.  The first is that newly created
	data (e.g. a new queue) is not available in the UI, because it's not
	getting re-fetched from the server when the tab is opened (or added
	to local data stores).  Second, certain form elements misbehave when
	the form is re-rendered without a refresh.  Elements, typically
	checkboxes, will appear to be selected when they are not.  (Or,
	perhaps they are, and the method to detect their selection is not
	sufficient).  The simplest solution to both problems is to simply
	reload the page....  This patch changes the tabs for Import Records and Inspect Queue so
	that they reload the page (focused on the selected tab) instead of
	just showing the hidden div.  These pages were chosen because they
	are the only interfaces that don't automatically refresh their own
	data and (for Import Record) have forms that need refreshing.  Additionally, since the user may spend more time loading Vandelay
	pages, this also fixes the long-standing annoyance of seeing the
	Vandelay UI partially render while waiting for the page to load.
	Now, it all remains hidden, except for a brief "Loading..." message.

	flag when linking a Limit Group to a Limit Set.  Both the limit groups and circ modifiers are linked to "Limit Sets"
	that act similarly to rules. Each Set can be attached to 0 or more
	circulation matchpoints.  Each Limit set supports a number of items out (0 replaces infinite),
	depth in the org tree to start counting at (0 for up to the top, 1
	for 1 below, etc), and a global flag (to check everywhere below the
	depth point, rather than just those circulations that happend at
	ancestors/descendants).  When a Limit Set is linked to a Circulation Matchpoint it can be
	made inactive and has a fallthrough flag. When the fallthrough flag
	is enabled the Limit Set will be used whenever the matchpoint is
	involved with making a decision. When it is disabled the Limit Set
	will only be used when the matchpoint is the most specific
	matchpoint used in making the decision.  Limit Groups management can be found on the server administration
	menu.  Limit Sets management can be found on the local administration menu.  Limit Set -> Matchpoint linking is done via editing Circulation
	Policies.  The upgrade script does not remove the old tables in case something
	goes wrong with migrating the information contained within them.   Conflicts: 	Open-ILS/web/opac/locale/en-US/lang.dtd 	Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/chrome/content/main/menu_frame_menus.xul

	Template Toolkit OPAC.  Mike Rylander and Bill Erickson largely designed and spec'ed out
	this feature, especially at the database level.  Lebbeous
	Fogle-Weekley and Mike Rylander did the programming.  How it works, for site administrators
	------------------------------------- Once the code is installed, including database stored procedures, (re)ingesting your bibliographic records will populate two new
	tables needed by AutoSuggest: metabib.browse_entry and
	metabib.browse_entry_def_map.  Yes, for now this means that the size of your database in per-record
	terms will be greater.  The browse_entry data we generate is
	extremely similar to facet data, so it's possible that in the future
	we can blend them into the same thing at the database level, and
	save some space.  To control what gets indexed in the metabib.browse_* tables, set the
	boolean 'browse_field' column for each row in config.metabib_field
	as desired Numbers 15 (keyword|keyword) and 16 (subject|complete)
	should generally be set to false.  The config.metabib_class  table has a new 'bouyant' column.  Setting
	this to true means that when a user is typing in the OPAC search box
	with a search class selector set to, say, 'Subject', and the cmc row
	for 'Subject' has 'bouyant' set to true, the top suggestions will
	definitely come from the Subject fields of MARC records (if any).
	'restrict' is like 'bouyant', only stronger.  In that case
	suggestions /only/ come from the selected class.  This is the idea behind the 'restrict' column (in both the
	config.metabib_class table and the config.metabib_field table): For
	any given class or field, if restrict is true AND the user at the
	OPAC has selected that same class or field from the search class
	dropdown, then autosuggestions will only come from that class or
	field in the record.  You never want this column to be true for keyword, because we don't
	index keywords for browse/autosuggest purposes (we would get giant
	blobs of information as autosuggestions, and you don't want that
	(really)).  You don't really want it to be true for most classes and fields.  If
	the user sets the dropdown to "subject" and start typing "harry
	potter", the user really wants matches from the "title" class too
	(although other things being equal, matches from the "subject" class
	will rise to the top).  If you have a speciality index, you *may* want to set restrict to
	true for that particular field.  For a song title index, for
	example.  To take advantage of this, you would also have to
	customize your OPAC to have an entry in the search class dropdown
	for 'title|songtitle' (or whatever's appropriate for your specialty
	index).  This is easy to do and should be covered somewhere in
	documentation for both the JSPAC and the TPAC.  The order of suggestions otherwise has mostly to do with how well
	what users have typed matches what's in your bib records, and the
	value of the weight column of the relevant config.metabib_field row.
	Examine the code if you're curious to know more or want to make
	adjustments.  The master on/off switch for AutoSuggest is a new row in in
	config.global_flag named 'opac.use_autosuggest'.  Set its 'enabled'
	column to false to turn off AutoSuggest.  If you don't want your
	suggestions to be limited to whatever's OPAC visible at the search
	org, set the 'value' column to anything that does not contain the
	string 'opac_visible'.  This could be a good idea if AutoSuggest
	seems slow on a large site.  Turning this on means introducing Dojo in your TPAC.  I tried to
	keep it minimal, for load time's sake.  There's no fieldmapper or
	IDL stuff play.  For now, turning this feature off will avoid
	loading Dojo in your TPAC.  Managing the little stuff ------------------------- CSS classes that
	    affect the look of suggestions are in this file for the TPAC:
	Open-ILS/web/css/skin/default/opac/style.css and in this file for the JSPAC:     Open-ILS/web/opac/skin/default/css/layout.css At bottom, autosuggest is shaped by PostgreSQL's Full Text Search
	features.  Some of the arguments that are passed to TS_RANK_CD() and
	TS_HEADLINE() are expoposed via options to the
	openils.widget.AutoSuggest and openils.AutoSuggestStore modules,
	which have comments.  You can customize your OPAC files to invoke
	these with your desired options without touching much actual code.

	Vandelay record match sets: fix bug loading some trees Reported to me by Bill Erickson.  The Vandelay Record Match Sets
	interface was failing to load some simple trees of match set points.  Example: http://pastesite.com/31643 The proximate symptom was this error message:     Error: dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore: Invalid item argument.      Source File: http://dev198.esilibrary.com/js/dojo/dojo/dojo.js     Line: 119 but the root cause was a problem in dojoize_match_set_tree(), which
	was failing to generate unique identifiers for each item in the data
	store it's responsible for generating.  Since that function is only ever used to deal with trees where all
	the nodes come from the database and have actual IDs, that function
	now uses the database IDs as is rather than attempting to generate
	new ones.

	Open-ILS/web/css/skin/default/opac/style.css: TPAC: Regular
	justification of columns in search result The search results page was constituted via a table, enclosing one
	table per row for each result, enclosing one further table per
	result for the attributes such as call number / publisher / edition
	that have been chosen to be displayed in the simple and detailed
	views.  The column widths for each search result row were being calculated
	per result, with the effect that title columns were starting at
	different offsets - a rather unpolished effect.  By eliminating the middle table, we can let the widths be determined
	by all of the search result rows together, providing a normalized
	result as the HTML deities intended.  We also move some inline CSS into style.css.  Note that IE 7, at least, ignores the :nth-child() usage to deliver
	the borders; because we no longer wrap the set of rows (including
	optional Content Cafe and ChiliFresh rows) in an intermediate table,
	we had to switch to a border-top attribute. We could have gone with
	a straight "tr > td" approach, but that would have added a line at
	the top of the first result, which looked weird. Still an option if
	one really wants to.

	gap between the two informational elements. In addition, as the
	elements are floated, the vertical alignment is thrown off if you
	attempt to bring them together.  The solution is to group the elements inside a SPAN with
	inline-block displays for the embedded DIVs. This enables the
	elements to reflow appropriately on mobile sized screens while
	keeping the alignment clean.  In addition, some inline style gets
	moved to style.css and some unnecessary elements are removed.

	today), there is now a UI control in the patron editor.  This UI control invokes a middle layer method that will clear the

	standing penalty against the user, for staff to notice next time
	they bring up said patron in the staff client.  Such penalties will
	be archived whenever that patron's email address or phone number is
	updated again.  The middle layer method is a wrapper around a method that may take
	different parameters (like an email address instead of a patron ID)
	to potentially support future uses such as invalidating email
	addresses automatically in batch.

	texting For SMS functionality we're basically converting a carrier and a
	phone number into an email address and sending via SMTP like other
	email notifications.  There is administrative UI for configuring
	these mappings:     Admin -> Server Settings -> SMS Carriers The permission ADMIN_SMS_CARRIER is needed to use this interface. In
	a stock Evergreen installation, this is given to the Global
	Administrator group.  In this interface, any occurance of "$number" in the Email Gateway
	field will change into the pertinent SMS phone number when the
	mapping gets used. We're not doing anything fancy here for verifying
	or munging phone numbers, but you could do munging in the pertinent
	SMS Action/Trigger templates, or better, contribute code for the
	OPAC templates and/or the utility method get_sms_gateway_email in
	Trigger/Reactor.pm.  Our set of stock mappings comes from
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways There's no automated process for keeping this up-to-date, though
	some volunteer with a Wikipedia account could add the page to their
	watchlist for changes and let us know if something needs changing.  Set the org unit setting "SMS: Enable features that send SMS text
	messages." (database name "sms.enable") to True to expose the
	following:   * SMS notification widgets in the TT-OPAC hold placement interface
	    (to notify when a hold is ready for pickup)   * "(SMS)" links next to call numbers on the TT-OPAC record details
	    page. The interface spawned by these links require user
	    authentication by default, but this can be changed by setting the
	    org unit setting "SMS: Disable auth requirement for texting call
	    numbers." to True. The database name for that setting is
	"sms.disable_authentication_requirement.callnumbers".    * New options in TT-OPAC My Account -> Account Preferences ->
	    Notification Preferences (we also add in some missing prefs for
	holds outside of SMS) There are two pertinent Action/Trigger templates under Admin ->
	Local Administration -> Notifications / Action Triggers:   * SMS Call Number   * Hold Ready for Pickup SMS Notification Don't disable these. We rely on the sms.enable YAOUS as the master
	on/off switch.  Also, it's probably best to have just one sms.enable for the whole
	consortium.  If you mix and match on/off settings here, then user
	preferences for SMS can get blown away if the user updates their
	settings in the TT-OPAC at an org where SMS is disabled.  Hrmm, the
	same would probably happen if the user jumps between the TT-OPAC and
	the original JS-PAC.

	shelf_expire_time closed date overlap test One-liner courtesy of berick.  * Steps to test This is time and timezone sensitive, so on the server: Change your timezone to America/Los Angeles: sudo dpkg-reconfigure
	tzdata Stop your NTP server: sudo /etc/init.d/ntp stop Set the time
	to 5pm: sudo date --set 17:00:00 Stop Evergreen, Restart Postgres, Start Evergreen On the client: Make sure the timezone is set to Pacific time.  1) Change the Library Setting "Default hold shelf expire interval"
	in the Holds group to have a value of "7 days" (without the quotes)
	for org BR1 (or if there is an existing value, you can keep it).  2) Create a bib with one item: htest1  (Status of Available) 3) Place a title level hold on the bib 4) Check in htest1 (it should get captured for the hold) 5) Browse the Hold Shelf and note the Shelf Expire Time for the hold
	that captured htest1 (it should be a week from now, unless you
	already have a conflicting closed date configured) 6) Cancel the hold and re-check-in htest1 (to remove the Hold Shelf
	status) 7) In the Closed Dates Editor, Add Single Day Closing for the date
	noticed previously in the Shelf Expire Time for BR1.  8) Place a title level hold on the bib 9) Check in htest1 (it should get captured for the hold) 10) Browse the Hold Shelf and note the Shelf Expire Time for the
	hold that captured htest1 (now the bug is illustrated if you get the
	same date for Shelf Expire Time as you did before, since that day is
	now a Closed Date and should be skipped over.  The patch should fix
	this.)

	refresh-like behavior in the patron display, and will catch such
	things as staff changing the user's permisssion profile.  An example of how you might test this: Admin -> Local Administration -> Group Penalty Thresholds New Penalty Threshold Group: Volunteers Org Unit: CONS Penalty: PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES
	Threshold: 1 Save Register user with Profile of Patrons Load patron, Bills, Bill Patron, Amount: 5, Submit this Bill Edit Main (Profile) Permission Group: Volunteers, Save The interface should refresh and show a Maximum Bills penalty in the

	from i18n Makefile and dirs Back in 46e233722f9d1ccec1bd97816bb055caa12f8096, vandelay.dtd was
	removed in favour of the inline Template Toolkit localizations - so
	pull vandelay.dtd references out of the i18n Makfile to avoid
	corresponding errors.  Remove vandelay POT and PO files as well.

	* build/i18n/scripts/update_pofiles: Add language update script for
	Launchpad -> Evergreen Launchpad uses different names for locales than we do in Evergreen,
	and we want to only update translations that are actually new or
	have changed in Launchpad, so dump some intelligence into a script
	that can help us with that work.

	OpenILS::WWWW::EGCatLoader::Util::_get_search_lib() function and
	sets the result as a new context variable, "search_ou". The org unit
	is determined as follows (first matching condition wins): * specific CGI "loc" value * logged-in user's preferred search library * logged-in user's home org unit * specific CGI "physical_loc" value The depth is set as follows (first matching condition wins): * specific CGI "depth" value * depth of the chosen org_unit As of this commit, a library that wishes to set the a default search
	org unit for any given user should set the "physical_loc" CGI param;
	after the user performs their first search, the "loc" CGI param will
	propagate through most interfaces. When a user clicks "Your account
	log in", the user's preferred search library or home org unit will
	be set as the new search lib.  At any time after that, the user can select a different org unit
	from the org unit selector to explicitly set the "loc" CGI param.

	    need the noun "copies" but "available" has been factored out)   * Create a "Holds" header and move the holds information under
	  that * Put the "Available copies" and "Holds" into inline-block elements     so that they can take less vertical space on a wide screen but     will wrap on a narrow screen.    * Fix the line spacing between LI elements In addition, break up the lengthy summary TT2 file into a few
	smaller parts. In particular, make a copy_counts.tt2 file as sites
	are very likely to customize this to, in some cases, not show the
	consortial counts, or in other cases to only show the consortial
	count and current search library.  Also fix some horrible CSS issues in the header in which the "Place
	hold" and "Add to list" buttons were above the title / image, as
	well as remove some of the CSS manipulation to plain H2 elements
	that gave them no top margin.

	Editing for Patron Cards Changes "See All" into an editing interface, allowing for changing
	of the active and primary state of each card.  Each requires a specific permission: UPDATE_PATRON_ACTIVE_CARD UPDATE_PATRON_PRIMARY_CARD Without the appropriate permission the interface will show the green
	check or red x instead of the editing elements. If you don't have
	either permission then the Apply Changes button is hidden.  As the editing interface exists, also show the "See All" button when
	there is only one card, but not when registering a new patron. This
	allows for toggling the lone card's active flag, as well as
	replacing a card but leaving the old one active.  To ensure that you can do the above, and to avoid some other errors,
	the new card on a patron is saved to the editCard variable, rather
	than using patron.card(). This both allows for "Replacing" a new
	non-primary card into place as well as avoiding issues with editing
	the primary and active states at the same time (the interface would
	try and update the new primary card with the old primary card's
	barcode). Also, when checking for duplicate barcodes, update the
	editCard with the barcode so the See All interface can show the new
	card's barcode in the list properly.  Finally, included is localization for the All Cards interface
	headers and buttons.

	LP896405: Address SQL upgrade issues getting to 2.2-alpha1 Martha Driscoll tried out the 2.2-alpha1 upgrade script and found a
	few problems noted in this thread:

	http://list.georgialibraries.org/pipermail/open-ils-dev/2011-November/007747.html"upgrade_log" does not exist > LINE 1: INSERT INTO
	config.upgrade_log (version, applied_to) VALUES .  This fails because the "applied_to" column does not exist at this
	point in the schema upgrade. Just remove the "applied_to" column
	from the INSERT statement.  This will probably fail because most sites won't have applied 0526
	to their production server, so move the statements outside of the
	transaction.  Also, in my own testing I ran into: public / evergreen function namespace issues we tried to address
	back in the 2.0(?) timeframe. New sites will have the is_json()
	function in the evergreen namespace, while old sites will have it in
	public, so we do _not_ qualify the function name and just let the
	searchpath handle the resolution.

	switches to the new Google Books API (which is both imminent and
	also necessary to make SSL calls work).  Though the information is
	scant, from what I have read and experienced, we do not need an API
	key to do searches and previews.  I have also not hit any kind of
	unauthenticated limit in several days of heavy testing, so I would
	figure we are safe (at this point) for normal end-user OPAC
	browsing.  Second, all Google Book requests are now done over https.  This
	eliminates the majority of mixed content warnings when browsing
	securely, though you still get a warning when you actually do
	preview a book.  In addition to possibly implementing protocol detection (rather than
	doing https all the time as a "lowest" common denominator), there
	are a few minor points where we might consider future changes.
	Those points are commented within the code.

	Improvement for telephony: just-in-time event revalidation One of the shortcomings with using the Action/Trigger based
	telephony in Evergreen until now was that while you might have
	overdue notices generated and sent to a system where Asterisk runs
	for later calling, but if the notice was generated on a Saturday
	night, and you have Asterisk set up not to place any calls again
	until Monday morning, Asterisk has no way of revalidating that call
	at the last minute.  That is, the system could not determine whether
	the items that were overdue on Saturday night are still overdue on
	Monday morning, and whether the call should still be made.  Now we have a workable solution to that.  The eg-pbx-allocator.pl script, which takes call files for Asterisk
	from a "staging" directory and slowly drips them onto Asterisk's
	spool can now consult an open-ils.justintime which in turn asks
	open-ils.trigger whether given events, enumerated within the call
	files themselves, are still valid.  open-ils.trigger is designed to run as a private service, so that's
	why we need a public service that doesn't do anything too sensitive.  This open-ils.justintime service can potentially be extended to
	offer other just-in-time information to the allocator right before a
	call goes onto Asterisk's spool. For example, that might be a good
	time to check the time of day and make a late decision on which
	phone number to use for a given user (day_phone, evening_phone,
	other_phone).

	Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/cat/copy_browser.xul: LP#848945 -
	Hide Empty Libs checkbox The "Show Libraries With Items" button in Holdings Maintenance shows
	all the libs with items regardless of the library/depth filters. One
	problem is that when the list refreshes (whenever an item/volume is
	edited, deleted, or added), staff using this feature have to
	re-press the button, which can take a while for some bibs. This
	branch removes this button and replaces it with a "sticky" checkbox
	labelled "Hide Empty Libs".  This allows you to do almost the same thing; you can set the context
	library to Consortium and the depth filter to the lowest depth,
	which would normally show all libs, but then use the checkbox to
	prune out the ones that have no children and no volumes(*). One
	possible use case that we'd lose is the ability to show a specific
	set of libs that don't already have volumes in addition to all the
	libs that do.  * - Also, the test for whether to hide an org or not is very
	simplistic, but easy to implement. A more aggressive test would hide
	a library and all its descendants if none of the descendants have
	volumes.

	* Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/actor/user/register.js: Patch from Jeff
	Davis (SITKA) fixing cardless patron updates Quoth the bug report
	(https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/851110):   On our Evergreen 2.0.8 system, it sometimes arises that a patron's
	  card gets deleted. If it was the patron's only card, it becomes
	  impossible to add a new card to the account via the staff client.    How to reproduce:   1. Retrieve a patron record for a patron who has no associated
	  card.  2. Click the Edit button.    3. Click Replace Barcode and enter a new barcode.    4. Click Save. This does not work - the process hangs, and if you
	  hit Reload, you will find that your changes were not saved.    I believe this happens because some code in register.js assumes
	  the patron has at least one card. I have a potential fix that this
	  comment box is too small to contain ... uh, that is to say, I will
	  post it momentarily.  Which he did, and I applied.

	server error caused by trying to retrieve an empty list of records.  $list->{count} in this context is the overall hit count, not the
	counts in the current page of results.  Note also if {count} is
	zero, the list of IDs will be undef, so we use both.

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Application/Acq/Order.pm: Avoid
	a possible bug in selection list deletion This particularly matters for the "ephemeral," unnamed selection
	list that Acquisitions General Search uses to hold bib records
	represented as lineitems, as that list is deleted for the next run
	of that kind of search.  It's possible to get lineitems onto that list that are in a state
	other than "new".  Code that deletes this list first deletes the
	lineitems that belong to it, but that code formerly assumed that
	there are two types of lineitems. "new" ones (that should be
	deleted) and ones that belong to purchase orders (that should be
	deatched).  That doesn't necessarily cover all possible lineitems on
	the picklist, so deletion ultimately fails.  This fixes that.  [update: now this bugfix incorporates a bugfix, the need for which
	was detected by Ben Shum. See LP #869581]

	only do so when the grace period ends on a closed date, but there
	are two modifiers to change that.  The first modifier causes grace periods to extend for all closed
	dates that they intersect. This is "grace periods are only consumed
	by open days." The second modifier causes a grace period that ends just before a
	closed day, with or without extension having happened, to include
	the closed day (and any following it) as well. This is mainly so
	that a backdate into the closed period following the grace period
	will assume the "best case" of the item having been returned after
	hours on the last day of the closed date.  Backdate grace period awareness: By moving grace period calculations into a shared location
	backdating can check the grace period, including extensions. If it
	finds that the backdate is within the grace period (before or after
	extension) then instead of voiding the fines for after the backdate
	it instead voids all fines for the circulation. This emulates what
	would have happened (no fines) if the item had been checked in at
	the time the backdate was made to take effect.

	Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/acq/search/unified.js: Really add
	*entire* selection list to a purchase order, when desired, and generally do what a user would expect when, in Acq, the user
	executes an operation on "all items".  This addresses LaunchPad bug #810030.  The fundamental issue is that an AcqLiTable, which is used in
	several different ways in different interfaces, may be representing
	items on a selection list (for example), but it doesn't necessarily
	know all of the items that belong to that selection list.  It only
	knows what it has drawn.  This addresses that deficiency by teaching the getSelected() method
	some new tricks so that it can consult the server in the various
	ways appropriate to getting a list of /all/ the items on a selection
	list, a purchase order, a virtual PO, a set of search results, etc.

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/cat/spine_labels.js: Modified
	spine_labels.js to retain UTF-8 encoding Dan Wells posted a fix to the DEV list for receipt printing that
	allowed the receipt printer to print UTF-8 characters.  I used the
	ideas in that fix to modify spine_labels.js.  In spine_labels.js,
	the url passed to the preview in preview_xul_192 was encoding the
	url with the javascript encode() function.  This function does not
	preserve UTF-8 encodings.  I changed the function to
	encodeURIComponent, and UTF-8 characters are now displayed properly
	by the spine label printer code.

	* Open-ILS/src/support-scripts/marc_stream_importer.pl: Read STDIN
	up to record separator then stop The initial (and only known) target for the importer is OCLC
	Connexion exports, which export 1 record at a time, with each record
	ending with the standard record separator.  There is no end-of-file
	/ end-of-transmission indicator, so the while() loop always blocks
	and fails on the timeout alarm after the first record is read.  Until a more flexible solution is in place, roll back support for
	reading multiple records via STDIN.  The original commit was 679506975f0efb6e2f6f17b0c19e3c53c5bfda44 Note, the feature being rolled back was not actually necessary to

	LP857460: Get the generic class scheme when adding vols In a default Evergreen instance, in the "Add Volumes" interface for
	a bib record with both LC and Dewey call numbers, the list of call
	numbers from which you can select appears to be limited to Dewey,
	even though the "Bib Call #" field is populated with an LC call
	number.  The problem is that here we're grabbing the first entry from the
	asset.call_number_classification table, and you might expect that to
	be the "Generic" entry - however, it turns out to be the "Dewey"
	entry because the entries are ordered alphabetically by .name(), not
	by database ID. (You can test this be changing the name of "Dewey"
	to "Vicious" and see that the "Generic" entry is chosen instead).  This commit changes the process to first search the acnc array for a
	name() = "Generic"; and then if we don't find that, fall back to the
	first entry in the classification scheme.

	their destination shares suppression with the current library.  circ.transit.suppress_hold will cause holds to go to the hold shelf
	instead of into transit when in effect. Non-hold transits should not
	check it. This should be useful when multiple parts of a library
	share a hold shelf, but are split on the org tree.  circ.transit.suppress_non_hold will cause items to reshelve instead
	of going into transit. Hold transits should not check it. This
	should be useful when multiple parts of a library are in the same
	building and have no need to transit items before

	so that we don't produce invalid JSON for our JEDI.  This commit also destroys the death star.  Seriously, the right way to fix some of the issues people have had
	is for somebody to learn Ruby and to address them either in

	lizer.sql: Generic mapping index normalizer Useful for mapping values extracted for SVF
	(metabib.record_attr.attrs) attributes to alternate values.  For
	example, you can map collections of MARC Audience codes into groups
	of codes for to create audience groups.  This normalizer takes a text parameter (in addition to the extracted
	value) that defines a simple mapping between input and output.  Each
	mapping consists of one or more comma separated strings on the left
	of a separator (called the source group), a separator, and a
	alphanumeric string to the right of the separator (called the
	mapping target). The format of a mapping is:   {string}[,{string}][..]=>{non-whitespace-string} For example:   a,b,c=>X Multiple mappings can be supplied, separated by whitespace.  Each
	mapping itself is not sensitive to most whitespace.  For instance,
	the following are all equivalent:  a,b,c=>X  a, b, c => X     a   ,   b   ,   c    =>     X In each, "a", "b" and "c" are mapped to "X", and anything else is
	returned without mapping.  Additionionally, whitespace within a string in the source group is
	tolerated.  Given a mapping of:   a e i o u, y, w => V The string "a e i o u", "y" or "w" will return "V".  In addition to explicit mapping, an empty source group will produce
	a default mapping, where anything not matching another mapping will
	return the mapping target.  For instance, given the following:   =>X a,b,c=>Y An input of "b" will return "Y" and an input of "k" will return "X".
	The Default mapping target may be the same as the mapping target
	with an explicit source group.  For instance, the following can be
	interperated as "map a, b and c to X, map 1, 2, 3 and anything we
	don't know about to Y":  a,b,c=>X 1,2,3=>Y =>Y As a practical example, simplifying the audience values in MARC
	fixed fields to three groups and using those values in a new coded
	value map would allow one to create a dynamically populated search
	interface that uses more patron- friendly terms.  For instance:   a,b,j=>K c,d=>T a=>A =>A g=>E The above makes the assumption that Unknown, Specialized and Not
	Coded should be lumped in with Audult, just to be safe, and General
	is for (E)veryone.

	overdue-ness. If an item is due at 2:00pm and has a fine of $.50 per
	hour, the first fine should be eligible for generation at 2:01pm. As
	it stands, the first fine does not generate until an entire fine
	period has elapsed, so in this case, 3:00pm.  The previous version of the code had a special case for day-
	granular fine periods, so a majority of fines were not affected.
	This commit expands the same idea (charging for the fine period you
	are currently "in") to all fine periods.

	the option to /not/ place a hold for the pre-selected user).

	Open-ILS/src/templates/vandelay/vandelay.tt2: Remove /default/ from
	template paths The original goal of having a /default/ component to the template
	path was to support alternate skins.  However, Template Toolkit
	supports alternate skins through a more elegant mechanism of
	providing template overlays via template path configuration.  In
	other words, skin files will be differentiated by the location of
	their root path and not because they live in a different skin
	directory inside the main template root.  Because of this, the /default/ component in the template path serves
	no purpose and generally just gets in the way.  As a part of this, EGWeb.pm no longer inserts the skin name into the
	template file path.

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/chrome/content/util/print.js: Receipt
	Macros: %INCLUDE()% Takes a single parameter: The name of the include.  Each include is an OU setting: circ.staff_client.receipt.<name> The includes are done as the first substitution. This has the
	benefit of allowing other substitutions within them (including
	additional calls to %INCLUDE()%) and the downside of not allowing
	dynamic includes.  Because an include can contain includes the code keeps track of all
	includes already done, skipping those already included. This
	prevents infinite loops when A includes B and B includes A, or
	longer variants thereof.  Primary intended use would be for libraries to place frequently
	changed notices and such in their templates. Instead of having to
	edit every template on every workstation they use the %INCLUDE()%
	macro and edit the org unit settings. At the next login the updated
	text appears on every workstation.  Due to the includes being processed first a library could use them
	to centrally administer templates by using an include for each piece
	of each template.

	Fix "Retarget Local Holds" for non-holdable copies Specificially: Wrap holdable check in is_true Add check for current copy status
	holdable Add check for current copy location holdable The latter stores the fetched location for later use.  The one later
	use I found updated to check if the location is a reference.  The update copy code already checks if location is a reference and
	deals with it properly.

	used in a secondary merge attempt for any records that fail the

	quality.  For example, you may wish to do a full overlay for all
	high-quality records, but only extract subjects or other information
	from lower quality records.  This also allows users to do
	record+copy imports for high-quality records and copy-only imports
	for low quality records (using a no-op merge profile like "replace

	org_lasso search is broken Fix the JavaScript error when we attempt to create a feed for the
	shortname of the org_unit_lasso (lassos have no shortname) - which
	lets the request hit the backend Perl module, which in turn chokes
	on a test for OU that only allows two conditions: either all digits
	is treated as a numeric ID for an org unit, or it is a shortname. Of
	course, lassos are negative integers, so we have to modify the test
	slightly to make it happier.  There was no depth for org lasso copy counts, and this was handled
	correctly in the main case by the
	asset.opac_lasso_record_copy_count() function and its staff variant,
	but when a copy was not found at a given org_unit in the lasso a
	request was made for the non-existent depth and the function would
	error out.

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/cat/marcedit.js: Only update MARC
	on full entry of fixed fields AKA: Lang is 3 characters long. Entering 1 character would cause
	focus to leave.  MARC would also update incorrectly.  This only triggers the update when the full 3 characters are
	entered.  This not only prevents issues with catalogers editing
	multi-character fixed fields but also makes it less likely they
	accidentally corrupt the records.

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/cat/copy_editor.js: Fix
	overzealous template application The idea was that we'd track templates if they were applied prior to
	copies actually being specified in the unified interface, and then
	apply them "for real" once copies were entered.  But these
	remembered templates kept applying themselves whenever changes were
	made in the volume/copy creator portion of the interface (possibly
	overriding tweaks made by staff).  So now we delete the list of
	tracked templates once they're applied to actual copies.

	without making any allowance that the test might be run from
	anything other than the /test/ directory.  This fix uses the dirname(__FILE__) approach to provide the

	field are not populated with a 003 field. This resulted in the OCLC
	number being thrown away entirely, rather than being moved into the
	035, as there was no corresponding control number identifier field.  However, given that we know that control numbers starting with "ocm"
	or "ocn" are special OCLC numbers, we can generate the 035
	accordingly even in the absence of a 003. This update to
	maintain_control_numbers() teaches it to do the right thing for OCLC
	numbers.  In addition, add an identifier search index so we can easily find
	records by their system control numbers (035 $a subfields).

	MFHD compressed holding fixes 1. Add new utility method to MFHD.pm:     holdings_by_caption(): return all holdings attached to a     given caption 2. Add 'passthru_open_ended' option to get_decompressed_holdings()     Previously, attempts to decompress an open-ended holding     would error out.  Now, in the absence of this option,     open-ended holdings are discarded and you get a warning     (since they cannot logically be decompressed), while if     this option is 'true' they are passed back unaffected 3. compressed_to_last() on an open-ended holding now more    correctly returns 'undef' rather than the unaltered holding 4. get_compressed_holdings() will now honor an open-ended holding    by treating it as "infinite", and thus absorbing any holdings    which would follow 5. Overloaded comparison operator now correctly detects "swap"    cases (where only the second operand is a holding) 6. Overloaded comparison operator now consistently treats    open-ended holdings as "greater-than" a single or closed    holding which has the same starting point 7. Fix 2 thinkos in comparison operator for overlapping    compressed holdings 8. Add new compressed_end() method to Holding.pm which can add    or set a new ending to a holding, making compressed if needed 9. Correctly recognize partially compressed holdings     If a holding is defined as:         863 40 $81.1 $a1 $b2-10     this actually means:         863 40 $81.1 $a1-1 $b2-10     so let's make sure to treat it that way.  9. Expand the MFHD test suite to better cover the improvements    in this commit There is also the beginnings of a _get_truncated_holdings() method
	for handling odd cases where an open-ended holding is followed by a
	single/closed holding, but it is currently commented out, pending
	further design consideration.

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Application/Search.pm: Make
	spell-checking case insensitive As it stands, if you search for a proper noun using lower case, but
	manage to trigger the "did you mean" functionality, all the words
	are 'corrected' even if just the case is wrong.  However, we are
	stripping out the best correction precisely because it is the same
	word, different case.  It is a bit confusing to explain, but here is
	an example: daniel potatoe gets corrected to: Daniela potato This happens because the current spell check is case sensitive, so
	'daniel' is spelled wrong, but then we remove 'Daniel' from the list
	of corrections (presumably to avoid possibly suggesting terms which
	would yield the same exact result set).  So, we either need to make the spell-check itself case insensitive,
	or stop removing the re-cased corrections.  Since the catalog search
	itself is already case-insensitive, I think it makes sense that the
	spell check should follow suit.

	home_ou has an available copy.  Anyway, the open-ils.circ.title_hold.is_possible method is supposed
	to return information about whether local copies are available to
	support such a function, but it doesn't seem to do so.  I think.
	Will revisit.

	* Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/012.schema.vandelay.sql: Bugfix for negative
	matches


2011-04-22  senator <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	* Open-ILS/web/js/dojo/openils/vandelay/TreeDndSource.js,
	Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/conify/global/vandelay/match_set.js: some
	changes in the UI to reflect DB side changes Negation and quality are now ignored for operator nodes, and are not
	settable in the UI.  Also in the UI, you can no longer replace the root node of the tree
	with a non-op node, meaning the root of a tree is always AND or OR.  This is due to some bug that hangs the UI now when you try to save a
	single-non-op-node tree, and it's not worth debugging: just remove
	the feature.

	Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Const.pm,
	Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/950.data.seed-values.sql: Option to generate
	lacking overdues on lost checkin New org unit setting "circ.lost.generate_overdue_on_checkin".  This org unit setting enables retroactive overdue fine generation
	for lost item checkin.  When enabled, the system will generate
	overdue fines starting from the date of the last created overdue
	fine for the circulation and working its way up to the checkin time
	or stopping at the max fine amount (consistent with regular overdue
	fine generation).  This differs from the existing org unit setting
	"circ.restore_overdue_on_lost_return", which only un-voids existing
	overdue fines.  Consider an item whose due date is the 1st, that gets marked lost on
	the 7th, then checked in on the 14th.  If set,
	"circ.restore_overdue_on_lost_return" would un-void the fines
	created up to the 7th and "circ.lost.generate_overdue_on_checkin"
	would create new overdue fines from the 7th up to the 14th (or up to
	the max fine amount).

	<dan@coffeecode.net> Date:   Tue Jun 14 21:34:15 2011 -0400     Avoid duplicate row issues in biblio.extract_located_uris     As there is currently no unique constraint on the non-ID columns
	    of asset.uri, ensure that we only select a single ID from the
	    tables until we dedupe the tables. Use an ORDER BY to grab the
	    matching row with the lowest ID so we can clear out the rows with

	<dan@coffeecode.net> Date:   Tue Jun 14 14:02:49 2011 -0400     Fix LP 797304 and 797307 - asset.uri parsing bugs     Per 797304: one would expect asset.uri.label to be populated
	    with the value of 856 $y, however, it was getting populated with
	    856 $u - perhaps as a result of the ordering of array entries in
	    XPATH() not matching the XPath expression. Instead of including 856
	    $u in the XPath expression for uri_label, just assign its value to
	    uri_label if uri_label is otherwise NULL.      Per 797307: biblio.extract_located_uris() tries to reuse an
	    existing active asset.uri entry rather than create a new row;
	    however, it does not handle the case where there is no public note
	    aka "use restriction" and will end up creating a duplicate row every
	    time the record is reingested. Teach it to handle NULL values
	properly.

	checkin interval setting OK, here's the situation, a copy went away on a week's vacation...  Support for preventing checkin of a copy that was put into transit
	"too recently".  The scenario that prompted the development is this: Copy at Branch A is checked in and put into transit to fill a hold
	at Branch B.  The copy is then accidentally checked in at Branch B.
	(Imagine a crate of items with a superbarcode gets checked in at
	Branch B and the copy in question was presumed to be in that crate).
	This puts the item on the holds shelf (assuming a hold transit) at
	Branch B and notifies the patrom the item is ready for pickup.
	However, the copy is still just embarking from Branch A.  This new setting allows libraries to configure a minimum transit
	time.  If a copy is put into transit and checked in during the
	configured interval, the checkin will return an (overridable) event
	that prevents checkin.  If the setting is not configured, this has
	no affect on checkin.

	behavior to an org-unit setting, but we will take the bold move of
	using a regular expression to prevent a future dates of birth at
	all.  Note that if a library system travels into the past, this will cause
	all sorts of problems in the patron editor interface (not to mention
	overdues). Please do not mix Evergreen and time travel.

	Open-ILS/web/opac/common/js/config.js: LP 791546: advanced search
	ISBN/ISSN in .staff mode In 1.6, advanced search ISBN/ISSN searches always operated in .staff
	mode, returning results whether the results should have been visible
	to the user or not. This confused patrons who saw records to which
	they had no access.  In 2.0, this behaviour changed so that advanced search ISBN/ISSN
	searches never operated in .staff mode. This confused staff who were
	used to retrieving records via the ISBN/ISSN search when they wanted
	to add holdings for their own library to the records.  The pattern for addressing this problem and satisfying both use
	cases is the same - use the multiclass.query.staff method if we
	invoke the ISBN or ISSN searches with the .staff method name.  One could easily refactor many of the search method bodies in this
	module to use the exact same logic, keying off the method name to
	identify the identifier field and the .staff portion of the method
	name to determine whether to invoke .staff mode or not. For now we
	just address the ISBN and ISSN entry points.

	works around the problem by storing generated_coverage as a JSON

	You can also specify a default label class as an org unit setting.
	However: 1) There are no interface elements for setting the label class of an
	individual call number.  2) The default setting from the actor.org_unit_setting
	'cat.default_classification_scheme' value, if set, is not consulted
	(that is, not set in the call number table) when new call numbers
	are created.  These two facts together greatly reduce the utility of this very
	valuable feature, as all new call numbers end up in the 'Generic'
	class.  While #1 has been addressed in 2.1+, there is still work to be done
	in setting this class on import. Also, which interface parts (if
	any) make it back to 2.0 is subject to debate.  This commit addresses #2.  See lp #787150.

	permission checking for updating and deleting volumes.  This addresses LP #784062 reported by Ben Shum, and I think others? Creating volumes was already covered.  The ability to delete volumes
	without permission would be less often an issue in practice since
	you would need permission to delete the volume's copies before you
	could delete the volume itself.  Anyway, this should square things.

	numbering 8) Special interpretation of $yps for early winters (i.e. winter is
	the first season of the calendar year) 9) Teach chron_to_date() about early winters The last two points deserve some special attention.  A large number
	of journals consider 'Winter' to be the first season of the year, so
	Winter 2011 means (roughly) January 2011, not December 2011.
	However, there is no explicit way to indicate this in the standard,
	and also the code relies in many ways on the fact that 24
	(chronology code for winter) is greater than 21 (code for spring).
	To work around this, we are interpreting a certain ambiguous pattern
	in a particular way.  Specifically, if you set $w to a digit, then
	set $y to 'ps24,21,22,23' (or some variation with '24' as the first
	value), you will get this winter-first behavior.  Also, the season
	is treated internally as '20' then converted to '24' when processing
	is completed.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20470

	again, which is not good.  Now you get sent back to the home page.  This may not be the ideal choice.  myopac/main may make more sense.
	Also, there is still not any clear visual feedback for the user that
	their hold placement succeeded.  That'll need to be addressed too.

	* Open-ILS/web/templates/default/opac/parts/header.tt2: Less
	aggressive URL encoding We were double-encoding URIs, as the url and uri filters in TT
	happily encode % - which is fine the first time around, but after
	you've already escaped everything as %nn the propagator was serving
	it back to url to be escaped again on the following page request.  The right way to do this might be to unescape the incoming query
	string, then pass it on to url for escaping again - but for now,
	using the entity version of & is good enough to begin with.

	Open-ILS/web/templates/default/opac/parts/record/summary.tt2: Ensure
	ampersands in URLs are &amp; per HTML spec The propagator variable defined in parts/header.tt2 holds the value
	of the CGI query string - which, as it comes off the wire, is a
	simple "&". The problem with this is perhaps best explained at
	http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp (and it
	explains why "&copy_..." gets converted into a copyright symbol).  By passing the incoming query string through the TT url filter and
	then replacing "&" with "&amp;" we avoid this problem at the source.
	From there, we have to address the other locations in the code in
	which we are manually appending GET variables.

	interface.  First, you are now able to set the latent
	'summary_method' field on distributions, with the most significant
	new setting being 'merge with sre'.  This setting effectively
	combines the sre marc with the generated holdings to form a single
	unified statement.  Second, the previous 'receive' functionality has
	been renamed to 'advanced receive', and 'receive' will now show
	items from an entire subscription, but not allow you to receive
	directly into a specific unit (you can still receive into new/auto
	units).  Third, a basic menu entry has been added for receving into
	'no unit', allowing items to be received not forcing them to be
	unitized.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20378

	 provided by the tsearch2 contrib * Provide default cover density tuning (config file)  * Move default preferred language settings from storage to search,
	 where they make more sense More on the CD tuning:   Evergreen uses a cover density algorithm for calculating relative
	  ranking of matches.  There are several tuning parameters and
	  options available.  By default, no document length normalization is
	applied.  From the Postgres documentation on ts_rank_cd() (the
	function used by Evergreen):       Since a longer document has a greater chance of containing a
	      query term it is reasonable to take into account document
	      size, e.g., a hundred-word document with five instances of a search
	      word is probably more relevant than a thousand-word document with
	      five instances.  Both ranking functions take an integer
	      normalization option that specifies whether and how a document's
	      length should impact its rank. The integer option controls several
	      behaviors, so it is a bit mask: you can specify one or more
	behaviors using | (for example, 2|4).            0 (the default) ignores the document length           1 divides the rank by 1 + the logarithm of the document
	          length           2 divides the rank by the document length           4 divides the rank by the mean harmonic distance between
	          extents (this is implemented only by ts_rank_cd)           8 divides the rank by the number of unique words in
	          document           16 divides the rank by 1 + the logarithm of the number of
	          unique words in document           32 divides the rank by itself + 1       If more than one flag bit is specified, the transformations
	      are applied in the order listed.        It is important to note that the ranking functions do not use
	      any global information, so it is impossible to produce a fair
	      normalization to 1% or 100% as sometimes desired. Normalization
	option 32 (rank/(rank+1)) can be applied to scale all ranks into the
	      range zero to one, but of course this is just a cosmetic change; it
	will not affect the ordering of the search results.    In Evergreen, these options are set via search modifiers.  The
	  modifiers are mapped in the following way:       * #CD_logDocumentLength  => 1  :: rank / (1 +
	      LOG(total_word_count))   :: Longer documents slightly less
	      relevant * #CD_documentLength     => 2  :: rank /
	      total_word_count              :: Longer documents much less relevant
	* #CD_meanHarmonic       => 4  :: Word Proximity
	      :: Greater matched-word distance is less relevant * #CD_uniqueWords
	      => 8  :: rank / unique_word_count             :: Documents with
	      repeated words much less relevant * #CD_logUniqueWords     =>
	      16 :: rank / (1 + LOG(unique_word_count))  :: Documents with
	      repeated words slightly less relevant * #CD_selfPlusOne
	=> 32 :: rank / (1 + rank)                    :: Cosmetic
	normalization of rank value between 0 and 1   Adding one or more of these to the default_CD_modifiers list will
	  cause all searches that use QueryParser to apply them.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20180

	to avoid displaying the use restriction field if its value was
	identical to the URL, etc.  Instead, stop grabbing $u and handle the case where use_restriction
	column is NULL gracefully, just like the schema intended.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20123

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/SuperCat.pm: Protect dumb
	JavaScript engines from having to deal with actual Unicode The holdings_xml format did not include an XML declaration, but
	adding that as we do here still does not make the Firefox and
	Chromium JS engines capable of consuming XML that contains Unicode
	content outside of the base ASCII range.  So, we invoke entityize() to convert anything outside of the realm
	of ASCII to XML entities. An alternative would be to invoke
	entityize() in OpenILS::Application::SuperCat::unAPI::acn but it's
	not clear if that would interfere with any other uses.  With this change, library names / copy location names with Unicode
	content can be displayed correctly on the search results page.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20112

	    record in the traditional way, through call numbers that define
	    their ownership * Each reader, as a barcoded item, can be attached through
	    Multi-homed Items to records describing the list of preloaded
	    content * These attached Multi-homed Items can be added and removed as
	  content is swapped out on each reader 2. Dual-language items     * Cataloger decides which of several alternate languages is the
	    primary, and attaches the barcoded item to that record in the
	    traditional way * Alternate language records are attached to this item through
	  Multi-homed Items 3. "Back-to-back" books -- two books printed upside down relative to
	    one another, with two "front" covers * Cataloger decides which of the two titles is the primary, and
	    attaches the barcoded item to that record in the traditional way * Alternate title record is attached to this item through
	  Multi-homed Items 4. Bound Volumes -- Sets of individual works collected into a single
	    barcoded package * Cataloger decides which of the titles is the primary (or creates a
	    record for the collection as a whole), and attaches the barcoded
	    item to that record in the traditional way * Remaining title records for the collected peices are attached to
	this item through Multi-homed Items Functionality funded by Natural Resources Canada --

	* Open-ILS/src/extras/import/marc2sre.pl.in: Enable marc2sre.pl to
	run reasonably fast with a large set of bibs Our previous iteration of marc2sre.pl used an ILIKE stanza beginning
	with a wildcard to match system control numbers without having to
	specify the institution's MARC code.  This worked, but was painfully
	slow in large bib sets as the database needed to use a bitmap index
	scan to find matches.  By adding a --prefix flag, the user can specify the institutional
	MARC code for the set of records and we can use an exact match
	against metabib.full_rec.value, which is immeasurably faster.  This
	is, of course, a problem if there are multiple institutional MARC
	codes in use for a given set of bibliographic records.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20012

	so this supports them.  Remove the need for passing in the owning user's password and simply
	do a lookup by username in the actor.usr table. This is a bit more
	secure as the password isn't exposed on the command line and you can
	easily set someone else as the owner of the records without having
	to know their password.  Add significant internal help via Pod::Usage.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19989

	Change label to "Reset Password" and get button out of tab ordering In a keyboard-intensive patron input workflow, pressing tab should
	not place focus on the "Reset Password" button; the password is
	automatically generated at dialog creation time. Setting tabIndex to
	-1 disables tab focus for the button.  Also, the button has been relabeled to "Reset Password" to be
	consistent with the previous button.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19907

	   barcode number, and all copy information on the same screen.  Also,
	   the ability to include some information associated with the call
	   number, such as classification scheme, prefix and suffix, in the

	   prefix and suffix reside in separate fields.  This prefix and
	   suffix should display in the OPAC as part of the call number and
	   should also be available for use in spine labels.   * Instant Detail for One Record Hit List - When searching for
	   records in the staff client, the ability to immediately land on the
	   bibliographic record instead of the search results screen when there
	   is only on matching search result in the system.  This enhancement
	   does not change the way search results are returned in the public
	catalog.  These features were sponsored by the Massachusetts Library Network
	Cooperative.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19883

	in eg.conf. Testing confirmed that the directive was not necessary
	on Ubuntu, Debian, or Fedora. As this warning has been the cause for

	* Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install: Build libjs from source for
	now until the Perl threading problem can be reliably tested The previous commit changed JavaScript::SpiderMonkey to be built
	without thread safety, but on Fedora we had been installing the
	js-devel package (which was threaded). As you can't build a
	non-threaded JavaScript::SpiderMonkey on top of a threaded libjs,
	for now we'll make Fedora build a non-threaded libjs from source
	just like the other distros.  Note that the problem with threaded JavaScript::SpiderMonkey
	surfaced on Debian Lenny when targeting holds. Lenny has
	libthreads-perl 1.71, but a number of fixes have been committed to
	subsequent versions
	(http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JDHEDDEN/threads-1.82/Changes) - so
	threading support might be reliable on more current distros. Once we
	have a reliable test, we might be able to go back to the packaged
	version of libjs.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19846

	well without one. As a result any checkin results in grace periods
	being negated.  The attached patch adds in-db grace periods for all non-booking
	transactions, removing the grace period from the fine generator cron
	job script and placing it on the circulation. Grace periods are set
	on the recurring fine rule with an override available on the circ
	matchpoint, identical to how renewal count can be overridden from
	the duration rule already. These grace periods are respected on
	checkin fine generation as well as on the fine generator cron job
	script.  The upgrade script will assume, by default, a grace period of 1, but
	has a \set line to change this. It will also update all circulations
	without a checkin by default, but another \set will allow disabling
	of that.  [ NOTE: for the history of the patch, see:

	default search path is "$user",public we started matching "$user").  Thomas Berezansky proposed a variation of the function provided here
	for changing database settings. By creating the function in the
	first schema file, the subsequent connections pick up the new
	default search path and all works blissfully as it once did.  Long term, we should probably move towards explicitly qualified

	enjoy perl but the awful, horrendous, unspeakable black magic used
	in CGI.pm has given me a great deal of trouble today.  Specifically, I could not really succeed in subclassing it. I had a
	kind of half success before, but I could only really replace methods
	in my subclass, but not call the methods unchanged from the original
	base class (CGI).  This manifested in a bug where I had been using
	the query_string() method preserve search terms across some pages,
	but that method had stopped working since I introduced the CGI
	subclass.  In an attempt to fix that, I discovered this document
	http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/CGI/#subclassing and tried the advice
	therein, and several variations thereof, but everything I produced
	caused mod_perl to consume memory until it keeled over from OOM.  Finally, I discovered that I never really needed the subclass in the
	first place, so long as 'use CGI' with no module parameters doesn't
	happen in the same process as 'use CGI qw/-utf8/'.

	inconsistent results when invoking LOWER() in C vs. UTF8 locale
	databases As reported by the Fundamental Science Library of Armenia, patron
	searches were not retrieving patrons who were known to be part of
	the patron database.  While the initial approach to solve this problem used an
	encode_utf8() call to encode the data before passing it on to the
	database, this turned out to break the patron search function in
	other environments.  Testing by Dan Wells confirmed that the LOWER() function returned
	different results when invoked against text in a database created
	with LC_CTYPE=C vs a database created with LC_CTYPE=*.UTF-8. As the
	patron search function used a Perl lc() function call to convert the
	incoming data to lowercase, the success of the call depended on the
	LC_CTYPE value of the database.  To avoid this problem in the future, we define our own
	evergreen.lowercase() function that can reliably produce lowercase

	from Thomas Berezansky: The attached patch adds a collection of settings for patron
	registration, as well as a new display mode.  The new display mode is "Suggested" compared to "Required" or "All".
	It shows everything "Required" does, but also shows fields flagged
	as "Suggested", stat cats, and surveys.  To control this and other things are the settings. They come in a
	few general categories, named ui.patron.edit.<fmclass>.<fmfield>.?
	where ? is one of the following: require - Flag the field as required when it otherwise wouldn't be.
	show - Show the field like required fields, but don't actually
	require it.  suggest - Show the field with required/shown fields in
	"show suggested fields" mode example - An example string for a field
	regex - A regular expression for validating a field Not all fields have all of the above options by default, although
	the initial list is the main limiter compared to the code side.  Also included are the following settings:
	ui.patron.edit.au.dob.calendar - If true, shows the calendar widget
	for the date of birth field ui.patron.edit.phone.example - Example
	for all phone fields without their own ui.patron.edit.phone.regex -
	Regex validator for all phone fields without their own
	ui.patron.edit.default_suggested - Default to showing suggested
	fields instead of all fields git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19663

	Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/SuperCat.pm: Add complete set

	those that were qualified; now we pull all of them, and if they are
	not qualified, we qualify them as "eg".  In addition, for some of the non-index attributes (sort, direction,
	site, available), restore the descriptive title that was previously
	available.  Slightly longer term we will add a "description" column
	to config.metabib_search_alias to store this information.  Also, we had always been using the global %qualifier_map in
	return_sru_explain(), even though the intention was to enable the
	authority explain index to pass in an overriding set of values. This
	commit breaks the authority SRU explain, but as it had been
	incorrectly dumping the bib explain, this brings us a step closer to
	proper explain support for authorities.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19572

	what "exact" was doing before.

	by a button labeled "refine your search" or something.  That way we'd not have to worry about reversing query parser syntax
	back into broken-out widget values. make sense?

	chpoint.tt2: Patch from Thomas Berezansky to implement circulation
	matchpoint value fallthrough, whereby specific rules can inherit
	values from generic rules.  Background, taken from
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/635463: Theory: Make the things returned (circulate, duration_rule,
	recurring_fine_rule, max_fine_rule, hard_due_date,
	total_copy_hold_ratio, available_copy_hold_ratio and renewals) "fall
	through" when set to NULL.  The circ matrix edit screen has had some changes too, partially for
	showing "Inherited" in some places where appropriate, partially for
	field ordering and editing display and consistency. The fields that
	show up earlier contribute to tests that will be applied to the
	circulation attempt, while the "results" that do not change what
	rows are considered are grouped at the end.  Pros: You can override a subset of those fields with a specific rule while
	allowing broader rules to fill in the holes.  This may result in
	less duplication of information across rules, making things easier
	to maintain.  Thus, this may result in less rules in general, and
	thus less processing time on sorting them overall.  Cons: Manually figuring out the specifics of what will happen will take
	more time/effort.  Changing a single rule may have a greater
	unintended effect on other rules.  Staff would need training for
	when to have a rule fall through and when to set it specifically.
	More time to return from the DB for any rule that is "falling
	through" to broader rules.  Examples for the following org tree: CONS -SYSA --LIBC --LIBD -SYSB --LIBE --LIBF Implementing the following "business" rules: At the CONS level: By default, everything circulates, uses DFLT_DUR
	duration, DFLT_RFINE recurring fine, and DFLT_MFINE max fine.  Circ
	Modifier "book" uses the duration BOOK_DUR Reference flagged
	materials don't circulate At the SYSA level there are no special rules.  At the SYSB level the max fine should be SYSB_MFINE.  At the LIBC level the recurring fine is LIBC_RFINE At the LIBD level circ modifier "book" uses the DFLT_DUR duration
	instead of "BOOK_DUR" At the LIBE level reference flagged materials circulate.  At the LIBF level there are no special rules.  The current method would require the following circ rules to
	implement those business rules: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC? DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE
	MAX_FINE CONS NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS
	NULL TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS book NULL TRUE

	DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBD book TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR
	DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBE NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE
	SYSB_MFINE LIBE book NULL TRUE BOOK_DUR DFLT_RFINE SYSB_MFINE 16 circ rules total.  The new method would require the following circ rules to implement
	those business rules: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC? DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE
	MAX_FINE CONS NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS
	book NULL NULL BOOK_DUR NULL NULL CONS NULL TRUE FALSE NULL NULL
	NULL SYSB NULL NULL NULL NULL NULL SYSB_MFINE LIBC NULL NULL NULL
	NULL LIBC_RFINE NULL LIBD book NULL NULL DFLT_DUR NULL NULL LIBE
	NULL TRUE TRUE NULL NULL NULL 7 circ rules total.  Starting with the above, lets assume that SYSA wants to change their
	recurring fine to SYSA_RFINE.  LIBC's recurring fine is to be
	unchanged.  The current method requires the following changes: ADD the following entries: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC?
	DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE MAX_FINE SYSA NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR
	SYSA_RFINE DFLT_MFINE SYSA NULL TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR SYSA_RFINE

	SYSA_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBD book TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR SYSA_RFINE
	DFLT_MFINE 4 rules added, 2 changed, total is now 20 rules.  The new method would require the following changes: ADD the following entry: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC?

	Open-ILS/web/templates/default/kcls-wire/results.tt2: started moving
	some inline styles into css classes Here's the deal so far: all the inline styles are covered by one
	class in semiauto.css, but those were created programatically and
	reflect no understanding of the relationship between the purpose of
	any given element that's styled and what its style is.  These
	auto-generated styles also are kind of redundant, since with many of
	them, instead of using the style with a long definition, you could
	use a combination of smaller styles.  The existing markup uses many slightly different style attributes,
	so there's plenty of stuff like "width: 12", "width: 13", "width:
	14", etc, so there's no way to map a lot of this to semantically
	meaningful names.  some of these classes are just going to end up
	with names like "wide-fourteen" that are no better than inline
	styles.  But others, as we find them manually, can be grouped and renamed
	into something meaningful, and sometimes style can be put into
	prexisting id and class definitions. Should be a couple more hours
	work.  semiauto.css reflects progress with the generated classes.  changes to style.css reflect early places where style could be moved
	into pre-existing classes.

	2, Open-ILS/web/templates/default/kcls-wire/record.tt2: JS stubbed
	out, mostly. See longer commit msg.  Here's the deal with JS so far.  A few instances of onfocus, onblur, onmouseout, and onmouseover have
	been left alone, as they're doing simple cosmetic things.  A lot of instances of onclick remain, and a couple onchange, but
	these now either a) just do cosmetic things (hide/unhide) or b) call
	stubbed out functions prepared in misc.js That doesn't mean we won't still totally rip out lots of this JS,
	but it leaves us a hint as to what is supposed to happen where.  I
	can easily see us losing track of that later.  So anyway, many of
	the stubbed functions will probably be replaced with purely server
	side functionality later, but until then, they can serve as a kind
	of documentation.
