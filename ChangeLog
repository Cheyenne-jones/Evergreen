    LP#1098377: protect against even more cstore segfaults
    
    Following up on the preceding patch, passing null
    as the savepoint name to savepoint.release and
    savepoint.rollback would also segfault cstore.

    Verify savepoint name is non-null
    
    Before we attempt to mangle the name, let's ensure that it's non-null.
    Otherwise, segfaults ensue.

    Protect against overly long savepoint names
    
    Per http://postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS,
    the maximum identifier length works out to being 63 bytes (+1 for the
    null terminator), so to avoid potential memory pressure by a 10GB string
    somehow being passed in as the savepoint name, malloc no more than 64
    bytes and copy no more than 63 bytes from the incoming name to the
    escaped name.

    LP#1098377: sanitize savepoint names
    
    When invoking open-ils.{cstore,pcrud,rstore}.savepoint.*, the
    caller supplies a name for the savepoint.  However, the savepoint
    names could be constructed so that the caller could execute
    arbitrary SQL.  This patch sanitizes the name so that it contains
    only alphanumeric and underscore characters.
