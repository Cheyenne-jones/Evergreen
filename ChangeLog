    Acq: EDI omnibus bugfix package
    
    EDIReader bugfix - Process misc charges better
        MOA+304 seems to be an encoding peculiar to Ingram for processing fees.
    
    Bubble up errors better from invoice processing
        Errors were getting logged, but weren't linked on the related
        acq.edi_message row in the database like they could have been to make
        debugging easier.
    
        This incidentally elevates one possible message from warning level to
        error, but even as a warning it was stopping the processing of the
        invoice in question there.  So there's no meaningful difference.
    
    Try harder to associate incoming EDI messages with exact right account
        Sites use many very nearly identical EDI accounts (same host and
        credentials) with different values only for the label and the vendcode.
        This allows mapping of an order to a profile on the vendor side.
    
        The problem with this is that the edi_fetcher and the processes it
        kicks off did not know how to map incoming messages to the right
        account based on vendcode.  That code simply iterated through
        accounts, using host information and login credentials, and grabbing
        what it can find, as if
        there will be no other Evergreen-side EDI "accounts" with the same
        hostname and loging credentials.
    
        This should help with that.
    
    Style and whitespace cleanups in O::A::Acq::EDI.pm
        All I could stand before I just couldn't take it anymore.
    
    New PO template created malformed JSON in the INC_COPIES=0 case
        And now it no longer should.
    
    Allow order responses and invoices to omit PO repetition in lineitem refs
        Usually vendor documents have bits of EDI that look like:
        RFF+LI:100/123
        where 100 is a PO number and 123 is a lineitem number.
    
        Sometimes, for some documents, B&T at least will omit the '100/' part.
        This is fine because we don't really need that number repeated for
        every lineitem.  We do need this change so that our EDI reader code
        can deal with the omission, though.
    
    Be more liberal reading EDIFACT message reference number
        Spec, if I read it correctly, says that this is alphanumeric, not just
        numeric, and ULS is one vendor I've seen taking advantage of letters
        and numbers in that space.
    
        This commit makes the relevant regex in our EDIReader appropriately
        more tolerant.
    
    Fixes to new vencode parsing for incoming EDI messages
    
    Prevent problem in preventing EDI re-retrieves
        The query we were using before would needlessly transfer large objects,
        potentially hitting Jabber message size limits.
    
        We're just testing for the existence of such objects, so we need no
        more than a single ID in the result.
    
    Fix EDI invoices for ULS, improve troubleshootability
        1) Taxes appear in different, but still valid way in ULS invoices than
        in invoices from other vendors observed to date.
    
        2) Invoices from ULS use MOA 203 to indicate unit price instead of the
        usual meaning of whole-lineitem price.
    
        3) Now abuse acq.invoice.note to leave better troubleshooting
        breadcrumbs.
    
    Invoices from EDI had unsavable invoice_items attached
        Deal with this by letting us create fund_debits a little later than in
        the previous workflow. We have to, because the EDI-level stuff creating
        the invoice doesn't know what fund we want to target for taxes and misc
        charges.
    
        The problem we're fixing manifested by showing an alert() dialog about
        ACQ_FUND_DEBIT_NOT_FOUND.

    TPAC: Make locale picker match default locale
    
    As noted by Pasi Kallinen, the language picker would not reflect the
    chosen locale unless your cookie had been set or there was an explicit
    CGI parameter with the locale name.
    
    Accordingly, get the default locale from the context vars and use that
    to set the selected value for the language picker in the absence of
    anything else, to prevent the picker from possibly confusingly showing
    the first language alphabetically rather than the currently displayed
    language in the rest of the UI.

    LP #1092921: Display of/sorting by CN affixes in Simplified Hold Pull List
    
    In the Simplified Hold Pull List interface, the "Call Number Label" column
    displays the call number of the copy targeted by the hold in each row,
    and it does so by combining affixes with the actual label field.
    Sorting of this column actually uses the call number sortkey generated
    in-database for this purpose.
    
    Sometimes this means that sorting order doesn't match what you'd
    expect to see with this column.  Opinions differ on desired behavior, so
    now you can explicity add columns to the table for call number prefix
    and suffix, and sort on either of those (potentially in combination with
    other columns).
    
    Amended from an earlier version of this commit that still didn't sort
    CN prefix and suffix columns quite right.

    Deal with opt-in boundaries defensively
    
    If a site had not set an 'org.patron_opt_default' OU setting, then it
    seemed that a DEFAULT value was getting dumped into the "create opt-in"
    INSERT statement for the org_unit argument, and that (as there is a
    non-NULL constraint on the column and no default value for the column)
    resulted in the patron not getting opted in.
    
    One way for sites to deal with this is to set an opt-in boundary at the
    consortial level, along the lines of:
    
    INSERT INTO actor.org_unit_setting (org_unit, name, value)
      VALUES (1, 'org.patron_opt_default', 2);
    
    Alternatively, in the absense of any such setting, opt-in should
    continue to work as it had before the new feature was added; this change
    keeps the old behaviour active in that case.

    LP#1098377: protect against even more cstore segfaults
    
    Following up on the preceding patch, passing null
    as the savepoint name to savepoint.release and
    savepoint.rollback would also segfault cstore.

    Verify savepoint name is non-null
    
    Before we attempt to mangle the name, let's ensure that it's non-null.
    Otherwise, segfaults ensue.

    Protect against overly long savepoint names
    
    Per http://postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS,
    the maximum identifier length works out to being 63 bytes (+1 for the
    null terminator), so to avoid potential memory pressure by a 10GB string
    somehow being passed in as the savepoint name, malloc no more than 64
    bytes and copy no more than 63 bytes from the incoming name to the
    escaped name.

    LP#1098377: sanitize savepoint names
    
    When invoking open-ils.{cstore,pcrud,rstore}.savepoint.*, the
    caller supplies a name for the savepoint.  However, the savepoint
    names could be constructed so that the caller could execute
    arbitrary SQL.  This patch sanitizes the name so that it contains
    only alphanumeric and underscore characters.
