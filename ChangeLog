    LP#1296937: move the $force_bc parameter of ->charged_items() to an implementation method
    
    Argubably, the $force_bc parameter of OpenILS::SIP::Patron->charged_items()
    method exists solely as an implementation convenience for the renew-all
    code.  Consequently, this patch removes the $force_bc parameter from the
    public interface for charged_items() and spins it off into a new
    implementation method.
    
    This patch should be applied at the same time that a reversion of
    SIPServer commit c97d64412bc is applied.  Note that a user who upgrades
    SIPServer without upgrading Evergreen to a version that contains this
    patch will end up in a situation where the code that counts active
    loans for the patron information response will fetch the loans using
    $force_bc set to true; this works only by coincidence.

    LP#1321017: Order constituent records by quality
    
    Previously, in some cases (often needlessly) we ordered constituent
    records within a metarecord by a combination of type/form/blvl.  This
    is not only of little use, but also expensive.  Instead, order them
    by the bib's calculated quality, which takes type/form/blvl into account
    already.
    
    Also, use the new metabib.record_sorter to find the title tie-breaker
    instead of using the view-of-a-view-of-a-view mrd compatability shim.
    
    The net result is several orders of magnitude speed increase for
    constituent record retrieval.  In particular, this resolves a problem
    where doing a SIP2 patron information lookup and requesting a list
    of holds could cause a timeout if the patron has one or more
    metarecord holds.
    
    This patch also causes the format filter parameter of the following
    methods to be ignored:
    
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord_to_records*
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord.mods_slim.batch.retrieve*
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord.mods_slim.retrieve*
    
    Since the only use of the format filter was in JSPac code, and since
    the record attributes mechanism has changed considerably, this removal
    should be considered intentional.
    
    Note that this patch includes a squash of a minor follow-up by Galen
    Charlton to remove variables made unused by the original patch.

    LP#1310751: Reorder query-building wrapper for QueryParser
    
    In order to make sure that the transparent boolean pushdown does
    not cause filters and modifiers to end up deeply embedded in the
    query tree, we put them at the front.
    
    This is a short-term fix.  Long-term, we need to make use of the
    floating subquery syntax ( {{ ... }} ) available in QueryParser,
    which is designed to address the semantic separation between what
    the user types into the search box, and the various UI widgets that
    can add query clauses.

    Add a short description for the new 2.6 feature "Lost Item Billing: New
    Min/Max Price Settings" to the only section where it seems to fit, and it
    seems obscure and hard to find. It could be useful to create a new, more
    prominent section for common Org Unit Settings, possibly organized by
    category. Sending this via GitHub to test the new Docs workflow.

    LP#1311467: fix heading validation in bib editor
    
    This patch fixes a regression whereby clicking the validate button
    in the bib editor would result in no headings getting checked.
    
    In the process, it enables 'startwith' to be used as a JSON query
    operator for all types of predicates, not just the results of
    transformed values.

    Rejigger 2.4.3-2.5.0 upgrade bits
    
    As reported in LP#1261355, Postgres fails in some cases when changing
    constraints on existing data inside a transaction.  This may or may not
    fix the actual problem, but it at least tidies up these changes, and
    will make it much cleaner to move outside the transaction if needed.
