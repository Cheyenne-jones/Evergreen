	* Backporting r14305 to fix <controlfield> creation and use (when
	  missing) bug:
	  
	  When we add a <controlfield> element we need to set it to be 40
	  characters
	  long, and full of spaces, otherwise the Fixed Field editor cannot
	  properly
	  set the positions.
	  
	  Additionally, when a Fixed Field is edited but there is no
	  backing
	  <controlfield> element (say, trying to set the Audn when there is
	  no 008)
	  then we will add the needed <controlfield>.
