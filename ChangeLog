    LP#1771422 Reset transiting hold copy status fix
    
    Avoid modifying the copy status in the hold-reset API when it's passing
    the copy off to the transit API for canceling the transit.  Let the
    transit API handle the status instead.
    
    This fixes a bug where resetting a transiting hold, and canceling its
    transit, would leave the targeted copy in "in transit" status instead of
    "canceled transit".

    LP#1752753: Guard against invalid timezone
    
    If the lib.timezone org setting is not a valid timezone, attempting to
    use it can result in an internal server error in the OPAC.  Let's handle
    the error with try/catch instead.
    
    To test
    -------
    1. In Library Settings Editor, edit the "Library time zone" setting for
       Example Branch 1, setting the value to something that's not the name
       of a time zone (like "invalid" or "UTC-07:00").
    2. In the OPAC, retrieve a record with holdings at Example Branch 1.
        You will get an Internal Server Error.
    3. Edit the library setting to use a valid timezone name, like
       "America/Vancouver".
    4. Retrieve the same record again. This time, the record will display
       properly.
    5. Apply the patch and repeat steps 1 and 2; this time, there should
       be no internal server error.

    LP#1746815: Fix sticky hold url param
    
    Renamed the hold_id url param from "id" to "hid" and prevent it from
    sticking in url's where it not needed.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Log in to the public catalog as a patron that has at least
        two hold requests.
    [2] Go to the My Account holds tab and edit one of the holds.
    [3] Rather than submit a change, click on the holds tab again.
    [4] Note that /only/ the hold you were edit displays, and that the
        'id' URL parameter persists as you navigate through the public
        catalog.
    [5] Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-3. This time, you should
        see all of the holds.

    LP#1765444: improve how MARC editor fetches fixed field metadata
    
    This patch fixes a problem where the web staff MARC editor would
    make repeated and redundant calls to two Evergreen methods to fetch
    data about fixed field positions and values if that metadata was
    not already cached by local storage or Hatch.
    
    In particular, this patch caches and returns the data retrieval
    promises, ensuring that only one set of FF position and value
    requests are made.
    
    Prior to this patch, each eg-marc-edit-fixed-field directive, of which
    there are 64, could end up invoking those methods when initializing
    the editor for a record type that had not been previously seen.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Clear all FFPosTable_* and FFValueTable_* keys from local storage
        (or Hatch).
    [2] Retrieve a bib record in the web staff client. Note that up to
        64 calls each are made of open-ils.cat.biblio.fixed_field_values.by_rec_type
        and open-ils.fielder.cmfpm.atomic.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat steps #1 and #2.
    [4] This time, note that only one call each are made.
    [5] Verify that the fixed field inputs continue to work as expected.

    LP#1770478: Offline org unit tree can break
    
    A thinko in the org tree reconstruction for offline mode caused the tree to be
    broken in some situations, when the orgs were not ordered strictly by ID in
    the list stored in the browser's IndexedDB storage.  This commit removes that
    requirement, and allows trees of any ID and storage ordering to be
    reconstituted.

    LP1749994 Disable payment button pending payment amount
    
    Apply payment button on patron bills screen should be inactive if Payment
    Received is blank
    
    Adds a test to see if there is a value in Payment Received input box. The
    Apply Payment button doesn't activate unless a billing or billings is
    selected and a numerical value is in Payment Received.
    
    To test.
    1. Add some billings to a patron's account.
    2. Click some of the billings to select them. Notice that the Apply Payment
       button is active.
    3. Apply patch
    4. Select some of the billings.  The Apply Payment button is not active.
    5. Enter some values into Payment Received.  If values other than numbers
       are entered the Apply Payment button is not activated.  If numbers are
       added the button is activated.
    6. Uncheck all of the billings to see that the activated button deactivates,
       if no billings are checked.

    LP#1756912: restore display of copy counts for preferred library
    
    This patch fixes a regression introduced by the patches for bug 1698206
    and restores the display of copy counts for the preferred library (when set)
    on the public catalog results and record details pages.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Log into the public catalog as a user and set a preferred library.
    [2] Perform a catalog search at a system that is other than the
        preferred library set in step 1. Repeat the search with
        "Groups Formats and Editions" checked.
    [3] Note that in both cases, the copy counts displayed in search results and
        the record details pages do not include a line for the preferred
        library.
    [4] Apply the patch and repeat step 2. This time, the preferred library
        count should be included in the display.
    
    The substance of this patch (with the exception of the pgTAP tests)
    follows an approach suggested by Bob Wicksall <bwicksall@pls-net.org>

    LP#1740537 Transit dialog showing wrong branch
    
    Always retrieve the latest copy transit from the server when displaying
    the copy transit dialog.  This resolves an issue where a just-closed
    transit is used instead.
    
    Add a filter to avoid canceled transits.
    
    Make the transit lookup call authoritative, since the transit may have
    just been created.
    
    To test (test plan courtesy of John Amundson):
    
    1. Sign in as Library A.
    2. Check in an item owned by Library B that does not have any holds
       associated with it. This will send the item in transit to its home,
       Library B.
    3. Place a hold on the item to be picked up at Library C.
    4. Sign in as Library B.
    5. Check in the item. The transit pop-up and printout will show that
       the item needs to be transited to Library B instead of Library C.
    6. Apply the patch and repeat steps 1-5 using a different item. This
       time, the transit pop-up will show that the item needs
       to be transited to Library C.

    LP#1765501: ensure that webstaff MARC editor can deal with short 008s
    
    This patch ensures that the 008 field, when maintained by the web staff
    MARC editor, is kept at its proper length. In particular, this solves a
    problem where input can get messed up if the user selects the entire
    contents of the 008 field and replaces it with a shorter string.
    
    To test
    ------
    [1] Create a new bib record. Ensure that the MARC record editor is
        /not/ in flat text mode.
    [2] Edit the 008 field by selecting its entire contents and replacing it
        with a subset. For example, this might be done when the first action
        that a cataloger takes is to set the 008/00-05.
    [3] Enter value in the individual fixed-field inputs at the top of the
        MARC editor form. For example, enter 'eng' in the Lang field.
    [4] Note that the results are wrong; e.g., the text ends up as
        "080419en en eng".
    [5] Apply the patch and repeat steps #1-#4. This time, the results
        should be correct.

    Previously, the "Record In-House Use" UI opened with the cursor

    select the "Barcode" field.  It is far more intuitive to have the
    "Barcode" field have initial focus.

    When suggested call numbers are pulled from a bib record, space delimiters are

    a space between subfield values.
    
    Also included are two small optimizations: exit early if no nodes are found
    for a particular bib CN definition; use map+join instead of a for loop and
    blind substring trim to stitch together an xpath expression.

    LP#1732591: (follow-up) fix major regressions
    
    This patch works around two regressions introduced by a previous patch:
    
    - record links from titles on the OPAC results page simply re-ran
      the search
    - record links from cover images on the OPAC results page dropped
      all paramters
    
    In one case, a 'record_url' should have been a mkurl() expression. In the
    other case, the prior patch did not handle the clear_params parameter
    correctly; an empty array is /not/ equivalent to undef, and all CGI parameters
    were getting cleared.
    
    This patch is offered in lieu of simply pushing a revert.

    LP#1748006 Patron edit juv flag manual override
    
    Allow staff to manually override the patron juvenile flag value
    regardless of patron DoB.
    
    Patch removes the ng-blur handler for dob and expire_date, which fires
    too aggressively.  The dob handler is replaced with a $watch handler, so
    the new and old value can be compared.  No watch is applied to
    expire_date, since no code is currently fired when it's changed.
    
    Change the log level of the "field changed" message from log to debug.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Open a patron in the web staff patron editor.
    [2] Apply a juvenile birth date (less than 18 years by default).
    [3] Confirm the juvenile flag is automatically activated (if it wasn't
        already).
    [4] Confirm it's possible to un-check the juvenile flag and save the
        patron.

    Currently, the "Total Circs -Current Year" and "Total Circs -

    and one for new circs).  The current JS only displays the count
    for the first item in the array, ignoring the other.
    
    This branch totals the two, resulting in the right result for each
    year's circulations.

    [4] This time, the patron DOB will be displayed (if the
        circ.obscure_dob library setting is not enabled) or the
        the field label will be clickable (and clicking it will
        cause the DOB to be displayed).

    LP#1739044: fix lock file detection in eg-pbx-allocator.pl
    
    Lock file detection wasn't working correctly.  The
    wrong operator was used to read the contents of the lock file.
    
    Testing:
    
    Running the eg-pbx-allocator.pl in the background multiple times will
    trigger the lock file detection.  Use -t to run in test mode to avoid
    moving any files while testing.
    
    /usr/local/bin/eg-pbx-allocator.pl -t -v -c /usr/local/etc/eg-pbx-daemon.conf &
    /usr/local/bin/eg-pbx-allocator.pl -t -v -c /usr/local/etc/eg-pbx-daemon.conf
    
    In syslog you can see entries that are missing the PID number when you test
    before the fix is installed.
    
    virt-asterisk1 eg-pbx-allocator.pl: lock file present (/tmp/eg-pbx-allocator-LOCK),  still running
    
    after the fix is installed, you will see the PID in the syslog entry.
    
    virt-asterisk1 eg-pbx-allocator.pl: lock file present (/tmp/eg-pbx-allocator-LOCK), 21039 still running

    LP#1745001 - action_trigger_runner.pl max-sleep argument broken.
    
    Fix the --max-sleep argument so it accepts an integer number of max
    seconds to sleep waiting for a lock file to disappear.
    
    Testing:
    
    Before Fix: Add --max-sleep=60 to action_trigger_runner.pl and view the
    error message that results.
    
    After Fix: Run the same command and notice that it no longer errors out.

    LP#1760223: Update HTTP headers to follow standard
    
    In the olden days, some browsers didn't understand the "attachment" content
    disposition.  They only understood "inline" but would let the user save a file
    if a filename was provided.  However, in these modern days, relevant browsers
    all do the right thing and know about both flavors of content disposition, so
    we, too, must change with the times and support the letter of the standard.
    
    This commit fixes downloading of MARCXML from the Exporter module.

    LP#1745233: Don't test for LURIs during copy location searches
    
    When a user is searching with a copy location or location group filter,
    Located URIs should not be used to include records in the result set because
    they are not "within" a copy location.
