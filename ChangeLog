    Sanity check cstore limit/offset param values
    
    Certain cstore calls (direct / json_query) that support limit/offset
    params called with a non-string / non-numeric value
    
    e.g. { "limit": null }
    
    result in a cstore segfault as it tries to call atoi(NULL) under the
    covers.  This patch prevents this by verifying that the limit/offset
    values are actual strings or numbers (i.e. return a value from
    jsonObjectGetString) and not JSON_NULL, etc.

    Hide OPAC-invisible holdings from SRU/Z39.50
    
    The basic_holdings Supercat method filtered out deleted call numbers and
    copies, but didn't filter out copies based on the OPAC visibility status
    of copy location / status / the copy itself. This has undesired results
    when third-party services request copies via SRU or Z39.50 and expose
    copies that should not be visible to the public.
    
    We wrap all of the visibility and deletedness checks for a given copy up
    into a subroutine so that we can avoid repeating ourselves in the
    basic_holdings logic. Also, if we missed a test, we can add it in one
    handy place :)
    
    (Thanks to Galen Charlton for finding two missing tests: circ lib
    visibility and owning lib visibility!)

    Fix LP 829630, Show in Catalogue not working on Bills screen
    
    The page is looking for a messagecatalog XUL element with id
    'catStrings', but is not finding it, and so we add it to the relevant
    XUL file.
    
    It's odd why it is omitted, because a browse through the repository
    doesn't show any changes that would explain the error.

    Use MARC::Field objects to append new fields
    
    While the deprecated MARC::Record::add_fields() method allows you to add
    a list of fields using a list object, append_fields() requires
    MARC::Field objects.

    lp1028514: fix regex replace in maintain_901()
    
    The regex used to insert the 901 field can put the new
    field in the wrong location if the MARCXML record being
    modified uses namespace prefixes.  This patch tightens
    the regexp to avoid this problem.

    Move Prefix field ahead of Names in patron editor
    
    In earlier versions of Evergreen (1.6 and earlier), the Prefix field
    was used to enter title information, such as Mr., Mrs., etc. When the
    field was eventually added to the newer patron registration screens
    (2.0+), it was added before the patron's last name field. Ideally,
    the prefix should be listed prior to the patron's first name instead.
    
    In addition, address label issues by changing "Suffix/Title" back to
    only "Suffix" and making "Prefix" into "Prefix/Title".
    
    Note: string changes would normally not be allowed in a stable release,
    however in this case the previous translation (if any) will still get
    pulled from the IDL for the field in question, so English will not
    suddenly start showing up in the patron registration form.
