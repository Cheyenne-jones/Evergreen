2009-03-27  erickson

	* using new common cat code to in-transactoin bib/volume/copy
	  creation. created streamlined PO creation method that creates po,
	  assets, and debits in one transaction. moved asset create logic
	  into financials.pm for consistency

	* set the provider on the lineitem at po create time. respond after
	  lineitem update

	* plugged in more streamlined PO creation. added progress meter and
	  status updates during PO creation

	* added support for displaying the value from the 'selector' field
	  for read-only widgets

	* added an appendclear function to remove child nodes befor
	  inserting a new one

	* plugged in intial lineitem table implementation

	* adding some initial readonly parts

2009-03-29  dbs

	* Fix for #54 - make SlimPAC search respect
	  title/keyword/author/subject/series index

	* Let's fix this typo and see what breaks :)

	* Naive implementation of protection against apostrophes in SlimPAC
	  search. Fix for #55.

2009-03-30  miker

	* pass the default search class correctly, instead of rewriting the
	  query (possibly causing user confusion); require a valid class be
	  passed to the middle layer code

2009-03-30  erickson

	* some layout tweaks for event def grid

	* repaired array positions

	* self is not defined here, use this

	* move the select list creation actoin in with the rest of the
	  linietem actions (dropdown)

2009-03-31  dbs

	* Fix closed dates editor.
	  * XMLENT forces quirks mode, and tr/table needs an intervening td
	  * XMLENT likes its JavaScript inside double-quotes on onclick
	  attributes
	  * Cookie.js was triggering 404 errors
	  
	  Thanks to dchristens from IRC for reporting the problem and Jeff
	  of TADL for finding the solution.

2009-03-31  erickson

	* repaired copy/paste 'editor' field name for acqpl links

2009-03-31  scottmk

	* Plugged some massive memory leaks.
	  
	  In one case we were leaking an osrfHash whenever we didn't use
	  it.
	  I rearranged matters so that we won't create the osrfHash unless
	  we're going to use it.
	  
	  The other leaks involved various libxml2 functions that return
	  allocated strings that need to be freed. In many of those cases
	  we had been stdruping the strings and leaking the originals.
	  Eliminating all those strdups should boost performance a bit,
	  and reduce the memory footprint.

2009-03-31  erickson

	* test script for printing a purchase order

	* added address info

	* added provider addresses link

	* some formatting

	* typo:actor.org_unit_descendents. run_time is now a date string
	  instead of a query

2009-03-31  miker

	* adding template_output table to support storing just one copy of
	  batch output

	* give the environment built by O::A::T::Event[Group] access to the
	  event proccessing object; teach O::A::T::Reactor::run_TT how to
	  use this special EventProcessor env element, optionally turning
	  this off via a "nostore" flag to run_TT

2009-03-31  erickson

	* fixed closing tag

	* set the nostore var

	* prevent some warnings in the logs

2009-03-31  miker

	* add method for creating events by definition(s) (array accepted),
	  including testing of inactive events, for a specific target
	  instead of by hook key

2009-03-31  erickson

	* removed remaining assumptions of an 'id' field on all objects.
	  use Identity column everywhere

	* in batches, 'event' is an array of events

	* fixed var name

	* created method that takes a circ-based event def and a copy
	  barcode, creates the event if possible and fires the event. this
	  is primarily for testing notifications

2009-04-01  miker

	* reordering table due to fkey

2009-04-01  erickson

	* Updated the IDL to match the table name in the sql:
	  template_output => event_output
	  Added an is_error column to event_output
	  Updated event.error_output to link to event_output table
	  Storing error text in event_output table with is_error='t'

	* disabling editing of sequenced fields is better handled in the
	  widgetLoaded function. removing this less smart version

	* recursive calls to _object_by_path need their own copy of the
	  path array so that sibling calls aren't left with an empty path

	* simple reactor that just processes a template

	* added ProcessTemplate reactor and new hook, format.po

	* instead of generic format.po hook, let's use specific
	  format.po.jedi and format.po.print so we can find the right
	  event_def at runtime

	* updated to use trigger for generating templated output

	* updated, autogrid-ified currency_type list page

	* autogrid the circ_modifier config ui

2009-04-02  djfiander

	* Fix code that loads MARC test data, add a couple of tests,
	  indicate that a bunch of tests are no longer "TODO"

	* Add support for split issue numbers

	* Add test cases for semi-monthly publication on fixed dates,
	  omitted issues

2009-04-02  dbs

	* Prevent error messages with many lines from scrolling off the
	  bottom of the screen, by truncating messages at 30 lines.
	  Also, fix some FIMXEs, in case anyone ever gets ambitious about
	  grepping for FIXMEs :)

2009-04-02  erickson

	* allow the caller to define a function that tells the autofield
	  widget to disable itself if it returns true

	* typo, descendents -> descendants

	* the key changes depending on which stored proc is called. use
	  whatever key is given to access the value

	* added an option selection column with associated methods. this is
	  separate from the dojo grid selection api, this it is often
	  unwieldy and complicates keyboard navigation. still need to
	  implement selectall

	* added delete all button

	* implemented select/deselect all. removed some debugging. disable
	  sort when clicking on selector column header

	* auto grid column width

2009-04-03  dbs

	* Avoid a PostgreSQL 8.3 type conversion problem.
	  Thanks to Jeff Godin for the suggested fix on IRC.

2009-04-03  erickson

	* fixed fund currency type datatype

	* return the fleshed event from fire-event-by-barcode

	* popup progress bar

	* added initial 'test circ event def by barcode' functionality

	* go ahead and protect tracker retrieval as well

2009-04-03  phasefx

	* sort item attribute editor templates alphabetically

	* Fix hold shelf display for solitary item. We expect an array
	  here, but if the array only has one element, then RemoteRequest
	  is just returning that element

	* "Hold Slip" accidentally replaced "Transit Slip" during
	  i18n-ization

2009-04-03  erickson

	* do appendClear so we're not growing with new tests

	* used admin_ perm structure

2009-04-05  djfiander

	* Properly pad dates with leading 0

	* Move 'next' calcuations into MFHD::Caption, since they depend
	  primarily on the caption and pattern fields.
	  Leave Holding::next() where it is, so a holding statement can
	  report
	  on the 'next' date.

2009-04-06  erickson

	* more autogridding

	* repaired the disable widget logic

	* moved generic object/event firing to apputils function. plugged
	  in PO formatting call

	* started plugging in PO printing, at least to HTML. this assumes a
	  format.po.html trigger hook

2009-04-06  miker

	* make PO formatting hooks passive; remove PO print hook, add PO
	  html and pdf hooks

2009-04-06  erickson

	* added a mark-po-received method

	* plugged in mark-po-received action

	* added delete-selected buttons

	* added delete operation

	* set provider on lineitem at import

	* for now, update the price when it's changed. will probably make
	  this more interactive in the future

	* save some space in the selector colum

2009-04-07  djfiander

	* a bit more refactoring of Caption & Holding

	* Start getting ready to handle more complex publication patterns.

2009-04-07  miker

	* teach acq to extract holding-related data from a named tag and
	  configured subfields

2009-04-07  scottmk

	* Use the new JSON parser

	* In oils_cstore.c:
	  
	  1. Check the return code from all calls to SELECT().
	  
	  2. In searchValueTransform(): insist that the function name be in
	  a
	  JSON_STRING.
	  
	  3. In searchFieldTransformPredicate(): screen the operator string
	  for
	  SQL injection.
	  
	  4. In searchFieldTransformPredicate(): insert another layer of
	  parentheses to avoid ambiguity.
	  
	  5. Eliminated extraneous parameters on some calls to
	  osrfLogError().
	  
	  6. In searchFieldTransformPredicate(): disallow comparisons to
	  nulls and booleans.

2009-04-07  dbs

	* Add a unique index on biblio.record_entry.id
	  On a large system (2M records), this reduced ingest time from
	  45-60 seconds / record to 5 seconds / record

	* Reverting the unique index on bre.id; it's a primary key and
	  already has one by definition
	  Creating the index probably improved the speed of ingest as a
	  side effect;
	  a reindex would probably have the same effect without additional
	  index overhead.
	  More investigation required.

2009-04-07  erickson

	* trying to bring some coherence to the basic components of an
	  order/picklist. separating across modules complicates the
	  process. more to follow

	* porting some more functionality over to the common area

	* moved marc upload into Order.pm

2009-04-08  dbs

	* Fix open-ils.ingest.full.biblio.record_list by passing a
	  reference to the list, rather than a scalar
	  Fix the return value of open-ils.ingest.full.biblio.record_list
	  by returning a true count, rather than a sum of the processed IDs

2009-04-08  erickson

	* added entries for acq::provider_holding_subfield_map, updated
	  acq::lineitem_provider_attr_definition entries

2009-04-08  miker

	* adding note and circ_modifier to acq.lineitem_detail; moving some
	  IDL definitions out of the "example" area

2009-04-08  erickson

	* added permacrud entries for acqphsm and acqlipad

	* more import work, more to come

2009-04-09  scottmk

	* 1. In osrfAppChildInit(): reduce the scope of the attr variable.
	  Don't call
	  dbi_result_get_field_attribs() unless you're going to use the
	  result.
	  
	  2. In dbi_result_get_field_attribs(): Eliminate the round trip
	  from string to
	  number and back to string; just use the string that's already
	  available.
	  
	  If the string is in a JSON_NUMBER, it's guaranteed to be numeric.
	  If the
	  string is in a JSON_STRING, it might not be numeric, and if it
	  isn't, then
	  PostgreSQL will choke on it. The old code would silently convert
	  it to zero,
	  or possibly to some other unintended value.

2009-04-09  erickson

	* continuing to slog through the import process

	* oops, result in true

	* events not guaranteed to have a code, treat display as such

	* added some debugging for now and initial status updates

	* let's go ahead and import the new order.pm even though it's not
	  done

2009-04-09  dbs

	* A long time ago, miker said we could correct typos in the schema
	  as long as we add corresponding upgrade logic
	  Let's take advantage of his openness before we hit 2.0 :)

2009-04-09  erickson

	* go ahead and sort ancestor list by depth so that tree-ification
	  is not strictly required

2009-04-09  dbs

	* Lots of people are stumbling over the "opensrf" (OpenSRF) vs.
	  "osrf" (EG) username, so bring them into sync

2009-04-09  phasefx

	* let's try reposition the Register button so it doesn't scroll
	  offscreen.. could work on scrollbars too

2009-04-09  dbs

	* Avoid a warning about testing against an undefined value

2009-04-09  erickson

	* fixed order by clause

2009-04-09  phasefx

	* fix for nasty little copy/paste regression, trying to support
	  null ilsevent's. This was preventing Force this Action dialogs
	  for multiple overridable events

2009-04-10  erickson

	* usr_attr got destroyed in a previous revision, repairing

	* plugged in debit creation

	* set copy location on li detail on import

	* added support for choosing to create bib/copy/callnumber entries
	  at order record upload time

	* added support for choosing to create bib/copy/callnumber entries
	  at order record upload time. added more status info

	* use the existing price-finding logic

2009-04-13  dbs

	* context_org_list is an array, and PostgreSQL 8.3 wants it
	  declared as such

2009-04-13  erickson

	* fixed status update variable for picklist / purchase order. store
	  estimated price as local attr, since the source is the holdings
	  data and not the primary marc data

	* added post-upload links to load the resulting PO and selection
	  list

2009-04-13  dbs

	* Clean up another minor typo (not referenced anywhere, apparently)

2009-04-13  erickson

	* moved generic po bib/cn/copy creation api into order.pm. more
	  progress update fixes.

	* started acq JS localization

	* plugged in per-po asset creation

2009-04-14  phasefx

	* syntax

	* workstation registration tweaks.. layout, help, and NO_SESSION
	  handling

	* porting the "top-margin label fix" from 1.2

2009-04-14  dbs

	* First stab at copying fields in the MARC editor:
	  * CTRL-UP pastes a copy of the current field & subfields before
	  the current field
	  * CTRL-DOWN pastes a copy of the current field & subfields after
	  the current field

2009-04-14  phasefx

	* remove stubs

2009-04-14  dbs

	* Patch to fix "insert subfield" shortcut key conflict in Mac
	  client
	  
	  Thanks to Alexander O'Neill <aoneill@upei.ca> for this patch

2009-04-14  erickson

	* allow the grid to render display labels for linked classes that
	  it can retrieve

2009-04-14  scottmk

	* 1. In searchFieldTransform(): make sure that the function name
	  and subcolumn,
	  when present, look like identifiers; i.e. protect against SQL
	  injection.
	  
	  2. Check for a NULL return value whenever calling
	  searchFieldTransform().

2009-04-14  erickson

	* do the queued ingest dance like vandelay. create assets after the
	  lineitems are processed so we can begin/commit the transaction
	  after each record

	* added status infor for bibs imported and indexed and copies
	  indexed

	* loosened perms for viewing group tree. fixed org_unit datatype on
	  pgpt

2009-04-14  miker

	* incorrect sequence name

2009-04-14  erickson

	* sql function to remove all traces of a PO. This is for
	  testing/development purposes only

2009-04-15  miker

	* teaching record merge function how to copy over 856 tags when
	  there is a MARC-mapped URI entry

	* have the merge proc delete the source record after asset merging

	* yet untested method for calling the in-db merge stored proc to
	  handle merging of master/sub bib records

2009-04-15  dbs

	* Enable field transforms to be named with a schema;
	  is_identifier()
	  was being a bit too strict and killing perfectly good calls to
	  functions like "permission.usr_has_perm"

2009-04-15  miker

	* move the duplicate TCN test to /after/ the final attempt at TCN
	  fixup

	* protect the org trail from the top of the tree

	* protect the org trail from the top of the tree WITHOUT breaking
	  everything...

2009-04-15  dbs

	* pgsql-server-dev is not a client requirement

2009-04-15  erickson

	* don't remove the lineitem and attrs if it points to a selection
	  list

	* if we keep the li around, reset some other fields

	* moved po create into order.pm. some other refactoring of asset
	  creation

	* option to skip asset creation at po create time with existing
	  picklist. similar update clues added to po/asset create that are
	  in upload

	* provide option to leave lineitem_details when purging PO if the
	  li points to a picklist

	* moved li_detail CUD into order. removed old lid code

	* added circ_modifier and note fields to li details edit page

	* added callnumber to the batch operation set

2009-04-16  scottmk

	* In oils_cstore.c: fix autojoin, i.e. the facility for
	  constructing
	  a join when the JSON query doesn't specify the columns involved.
	  
	  When looking up a foreign key linkage in the IDL, ignore the
	  parent
	  table's end of the link (where reltype = "has_many"), because the
	  parent doesn't know the name of the column at the other end.
	  
	  Now an autojoin can work regardless of which table is subordinate
	  to which.

2009-04-16  dbs

	* Double-dashes anger the XML gods if you try to comment out the
	  example extensions

2009-04-16  erickson

	  rollback. li/lid ui to come

	* initial support for lineitem notes

	* ML lineitem note CUD method

	* create / edit lineitem notes

	* more notes tweaks

	* don't append to the catalog link if it's already set

	* logic bug

2009-04-16  scottmk

	* In oils_cstore.c, tightened validation for partial autojoins,
	  i.e.
	  when the query specifies only one of the join columns.
	  
	  When looking up the other join column in the IDL, make sure that
	  the
	  link used points to the right table. Also make sure that the
	  reltype
	  for the link is not "has_many", because that would imply that the
	  link is virtual, and the designated column doesn't exist in the
	  database.

2009-04-16  erickson

	* fixed logic error in check lineitem received. don't update
	  picklist/po on li update becuase we're re-updating over and over

	* implemented lineitem and lineitem_detail receive

2009-04-17  erickson

	* thinko

	* 'funding types' is a misnomer.. they're just funds

2009-04-17  dbs

	* MODS33 introduced some annoying changes to the way URLs are
	  treated;
	  ind2=0 no longer generates a location element, just a uri. ugh.
	  
	  Roll back to MODS32 for index and display purposes.

2009-04-17  miker

	* adding explicit feed support for MODS 3.2 and 3.3, to support
	  item/volume data (-full mode) in feeds

	* adding item-age axis to the browse interface

2009-04-17  scottmk

	* Add CREATE TABLE statements, and the associated IDL entries,
	  for two new tables:
	  
	  acq.fund_tag
	  acq.fund_tag_map

2009-04-17  miker

	* provide a non-emtpy default for the site portion of the pathinfo

2009-04-19  dbs

	* Remove variables that aren't actually used anywhere in the script

2009-04-19  erickson

	* more enhanced lineitem price setting. updates existing debits if
	  necessary

2009-04-20  erickson

	* added virtual fields for total encumbered and total spent for a
	  PO

	* added option to flesh total spent/encumbered for a PO

	* show some PO summary info along the top

	* added selection list merge and clone plus some minor tweaks to
	  processing status updates

	* don't update li on each li detail update, let the calling code do
	  that for efficiency

	* implemented list clone and merge

	* respond after li update, may not be any lid's

	* fixed some grid update and progress bugs with merge/clone

	* for consistency, give org unit a reporter:selector field (of
	  shortname)

	* treat linked aou objects with datatype = 'link' the same as
	  dataype = 'org_unit' objects

	* fetch lineitems in substream since they are so large

	* ported picklist page to autogrid for consistency

	* strange things happen when you have to progress dialogs.. the
	  page strethes out, not sure why. make it so a given dialog can be
	  either indeterminate or not for reuse

	* moved picklist delete into order.pm. code re-use

	* only one progress dialog

	* oops, gotta commit

	* simplify progress dialog. pass true to show to make it
	  indeterminate

	* clear away the li notes if necessary

	* slight wording change

	* if the bibs and holdings have already been loaded into the ILS,
	  the marc from the order record is no longer of much use. by
	  default, let's show the live marc record and give a link to open
	  the marc editor for the live marc record from the lineitem info
	  page

	* use the smart lineitem price updater to handle exising fund
	  debits

	* wrap the ils-marc edit button in a perm

2009-04-21  erickson

	* clean up the lineitem notes handling. clean up actions dropdown

	* don't create dummy barcodes and callnumbers until it's absolutely
	  necessary (i.e. at asset import time)

	* for a given lineitem, give each lid that does not have a
	  callnumber label defined the same callnumber

2009-04-21  miker

	* adding Dojo build profile (v1) for the OPAC (all thanks go to
	  lmcfarland!)

	  <field>

	* force UTF-8 encoding of records when so requested (they already
	  are UTF-8, just forcing the flag)

2009-04-21  erickson

	* pass in the build ID and urls map to embedded browsers

	* function to get the XUL build id

	* when isXUL, load the linked bib record in the usual opac details
	  wrapper tab, so we can access holdings maintenance, etc.

2009-04-21  miker

	* Patch from James Fournie fixing regression of copy display in
	  deep hierarchies which was introduced by a partial fixed in
	  r12470

2009-04-21  erickson

2009-04-21  scottmk

	* Add <field> entries for two new create_time columns,
	  in acq.fund_debit and acq.fund_allocation.

	* Added create_time columns to acq.fund_debit and
	  acq.fund_allocation.

2009-04-21  erickson

	* create events after the commit to prevent any possible race
	  condition. also, no need for the manual activity log entry

	* permacrud entries for purchase order

	* import stuff before using it

	* by default, load the most recently accessed 'local' purchase
	  orders. made filters non-required, horizonatalized filter layout.
	  ported to autogrid

2009-04-22  dbs

2009-04-22  erickson

	* $pen is an object in this case, not a hash

	* building the grid cell widget forces server fetches, which cause
	  grid display to act wonky. disabling for now until I can put
	  together some pre-draw fetching logic

2009-04-22  miker

	* When loading the IDL code in C or Perl: generate the
	  array_positions

	  (rather than from attributes in the <field> elements).
	  
	  In most cases this change will make no difference, because the
	  fields appear in sequence. However for classes "brn" and "mvr"
	  the
	  sequences of fields in the IDL are scrambled. For those classes,
	  this change will effectively renumber the fields.
	  
	  This commit does not affect the corresponding Python or Java
	  code.
	  So don't go editing the IDL yet to remove the array_position
	  attributes.

	  by a JSON_HASH. The old code would often silently ignore a
	  malformed ORDER BY clause.
	  
	  (Note: the output of diff makes this change look spectacularly

	* removing namspace prefixes on holdings extentions

2009-05-01  dbs

	* Add a basic holdings retrieval format - more flexible than the
	  XML holdings, but less detailed
	  
	  Should be enough info to flesh out Z39.50 holdings, at least

	* Proof of concept holdings-in-SRU results
	  
	  Based on what seems to be the best holdings option of a poor lot
	  from
	  http://vdxipedia.oclc.org/index.php/Holdings_Parsing - apparently
	  standard MFHD doesn't exist, despite
	  http://www.loc.gov/marc/holdings/hd852.html
	  
	  As miker says, code from this should be factored out
	  from a few different places, and this needs to be much
	  more configurable, and holdings values need to be escaped...

	* Just add a single record to the SRU results without a collection
	  wrapper

	* Increase default maximumRecords from 10 to 50
	  
	  This is a stop-gap measure until simple2zoom / SRU can be taught
	  to work together on paging

2009-05-01  miker

2009-05-02  scottmk

	* Introduce a new syntax for specifying an ORDER BY clause

	  {
	  "select":{ "au":[ "family_name", "id" ] },
	  "from": "au",
	  "order_by":
	  [
	  {

	  "direction":"D"
	  },
	  {
	  "class":"au",
	  "field":"id"
	  }
	  ]
	  }
	  
	  This syntax is more flexible than the old syntax, because columns
	  from the same table don't have to be grouped together.
	  
	  Planned but not yet implemented: "transform" and "params" tag for
	  passing a column through a transforming function.

	* A little messy, but this should get the Back/Forward buttons
	  working again for browsers embedded in the staff client. Model
	  after the old 'cmd_local_admin' section in menu.js
	  
	  Here's the problem in a nutshell: <browser> behaves differently
	  if loaded from chrome:// versus https?://
	  
	  In particular, the webNavigation for a browser does not work if
	  the <browser> is coming from http, so Back & Forward buttons will
	  not work.
	  
	  There's been churn trying to work around this, and past
	  differences between remote/chrome browsers. The use of chrome
	  browser is preventing us from making the top-level menu system
	  (menu.js) remote xul where it would be easier to deploy changes
	  and local customizations. remote xul where it would be easier to
	  deploy changes and local customizations.
	  
	  urls.XUL_BROWSER --> chrome/content/util/browser.xul is a wrapper
	  for chrome-based <browser>
	  urls.XUL_REMOTE_BROWSER --> chrome/content/util/rbrowser.xul is a
	  wrapper for non chrome-based <browser>
	  chrome/content/util/browser.js is the javascript in common
	  between the two
	  
	  Since menu.js is currently chrome, we need to use XUL_BROWSER.
	  
	  Since menu.js is chrome, it doesn't magically know the remote
	  server we're connecting to. So URL's passed to XUL_BROWSER need
	  to be wrapped or decorated with obj.url_prefix(), which looks up
	  the hostname given during the login sequence.
	  
	  Does this make sense? :)

	* the Toggle Summary button and the grippy now do the same thing
	  and don't impede each other. End result, Patron Summary sidebar
	  can be toggled more easily

	* another fix for auto-hiding patron summary sidebar. Current
	  behavior is for sidebar to display on first patron load, and then
	  shrink/toggle when loading a sub-interface. Summary can be
	  redisplayed by clicking clicking grippy, dragging slider, or
	  using Other -> Toggle Summary menu

	* have Circ -> Retrieve Last Patron chose the right patron display
	  (horiz vs vertical summary sidebar)

	* Make an org setting for the network activity meter. It's not
	  ready for prime-time yet

	* only do the auto-hiding of patron summary once per invocation of
	  the interface. IOW, if staff wants to unhide the summary after it
	  collapses, let it stay unhidden even when further navigating the
	  display

	* make sure these patron sub-interfaces can spawn new patron tabs
	  if need be. Fixes Retrieve Patron from Group interface

2009-05-18  phasefx

	* make clicking on the grippy in the z39.50 client and pressing the
	  Hide/Show Top Pane button do the same thing/play well together.
	  The text 'Hide' versus 'Show' can get out of sync, though. Could
	  punt and relabel it 'Toggle'

	* In SELECT(): Eliminate a sanity check and error message because
	  they are now redundant.
	  
	  We don't need to verify that a class in the SELECT clause is
	  defined in the IDL, because we also verify that the class is
	  referenced in the FROM clause, and all of those classes have
	  already been vetted against the IDL.

2009-05-25  dbs

	* Serials: point MFHD records at the master bib record when merging
	  bibs

	* Intended defence against lack of caption was still failing; keep
	  it simple, dbs

	* Add a serial search method that returns an array of MFHD hashes
	  for a given bib record
	  
	  This enables libraries to display multiple MFHD records per bib
	  record, for example if
	  a library has serial holdings for a given journal in microfiche,
	  microfilm, and print,
	  the holdings can be represented separately.
	  
	  Note that we are not currently identifying which MFHD record is
	  providing the
	  holdings coverage; the likely short-term plan will be to display
	  location information
	  such as 852 $c.

	* Display an array of MFHD records per bib record
	  
	  Reduce some of code duplication
	  Get ready for translation by breaking out the strings
	  Introduce spaces between entries in flattened holdings so that we
	  don't end up with 800-character wide displays of the Economist
	  holdings
	  
	  We need to enable the MFHD editor button to invoke the correct
	  MFHD record, probably by adding MFHD ID to the svr definition

	* Handle the merge of users for serials

2009-05-26  dbs

	* More polish for MFHD record display
	  * Add an owning_lib to SRE and SVR so that holdings are scoped to
	  the search location
	  * Add owning_lib as a context for deleting, merging, and updating
	  MFHD records
	  * Make the comma spacing regex global so that all current issues
	  will be separated by a comma followed by a space
	  * Use the MFHD id to invoke the MARC editor directly

	* Fix bad merge, regret being up this late

2009-05-26  erickson

	* layout tweaks

	* created hooks and drop points for damaged and checkout.damaged,

2009-05-26  erickson

	* if an explicit event-def-id is provided, assume that's what the

	  testing

	* action_trigger tables that link to a specific event def are now
	  configured on a separate page where the event def is implied by
	  the URL so that an event_def will not have to be chosen by the
	  user when configuring params/environment.
	  
	  top-level action_trigger page shows event defs (which link to an
	  event_def_data page), hooks, reactors, validators, etc.

	* Patch from Jeff Godin (MLC/TADL) which:
	  
	  Fixes the mixed content warnings from IE7 and IE8 "out of the
	  box" without
	  breaking sites that use static servers for CSS and Javascript.
	  
	  This sets OILS_PROTOCOL based on the environment variable HTTPS
	  (which
	  Apache sets to "on" for https:// requests).
	  
	  Thus, a page loaded via https:// gets https:// urls, and a page
	  loaded via
	  http:// gets http:// urls.
	  
	  To accommodate sites with static servers that can not support
	  https,
	  there's a new OILS_OPAC_STATIC_PROTOCOL variable in eg_vhost.conf
	  which can be set to "http" to force JS/CSS to be loaded over
	  http://
	  (you'll get the same warnings that you got before).

	  Previously, invalid MFHD records would be hidden from the staff

	  display a default
	  location of "MFHD" inside the staff client if things are so
	  messed up that even
	  the location isn't visible.

	* Add some logging to MFHDParser.pm, and prevent returning raw
	  parsing errors to the client
	  
	  In concert with c13383, this will give cataloguers the ability to
	  fix errors in MFHD records
	  without requiring a system administrator to manipulate SQL
	  directly. Sweet relief.

	* Open-ILS/web/opac/common/js/opac_utils.js,
	  Open-ILS/web/opac/skin/default/js/holds.js: Patch from Jeff Godin
	  to make holds placed by staff respect the patron's notification
	  preferences.
	  
	  The attached patch should fix a bug which resulted in patron
	  notification
	  preferences (phone/email/both) being ignored in favor of the
	  staff user's
	  notification preferences when staff place a hold on behalf of
	  another
	  user.
	  
	  BUG: When staff place a hold for another user, the staff member's
	  notification preferences (not the recipient user's) are
	  consulted.
	  
	  This patch fixes that bug, as well as a bug where notification
	  selections
	  were not reset between canceled attempts to place holds for
	  different
	  recipients.
	  
	  There is also a minor change to grabUserPrefs() regarding which
	  session
	  variable to send as an auth token (now uses G.user.session, which
	  seems to
	  be an acceptable convention used elsewhere. This was needed, as
	  the passed
	  user does not always have a valid session.
