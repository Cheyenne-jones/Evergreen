    LP#1592891: Fix SIP2 standing penalty failures
    
    Update too_many_overdue and excessive_fines in OpenILS::SIP::Patron
    to account for the fact that the user object in this context no
    longer contains an array of ausp objects, but just an array of ausp
    IDs.
    
    This fixes SIP2 failures with patron information messages when a
    patron has one or more blocking penalties that are not otherwise
    ignored.

    LP#1526858: speed up queries for shelf-expired holds during checkin
    
    This patch adds indexes on action.hold_request and tweaks
    the definition of the alhr IDL view to more efficiently
    identify holds that can be canceled if the "Clear Holds Shelf"
    checkin modifier is in use.  This can prevent a problem
    where such checkins can time out in very large databases.
    
    The tweaks were created by Jason Etheridge and have been in
    production at a large consortium for some time.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] With a suitably large database, set up an item that
        is on the holds shelf but has passed its shelf-expiration
        time, then check it in using the "Clear Holds Shelf" modifier.
    [2] The checkin may fail with a "network failure" message due
        the query on the alhr timing out.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the checkin
        should succeed.

    LP#1566016: remove SSN as a stock ident type
    
    This patch removes the SSN (Social Security Number) as a stock
    patron identification type, as it is no longer recommended
    practice for libraries to store SSNs.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Verify that in a fresh installation of Evergreen that
        has this patch in place, that SSN is no longer listed
        as a patron identification type.

    LP#1373578: fix translatability of hold placement errors
    
    This patch fixes a circumstance where ->maketext() could be
    passed an empty string, causing it to emit the PO file header text
    rather than a desired string.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Configure Evergreen to use a TPAC localization (e.g.,
        the Czech translation).
    [2] Enable the "Has Local Copy Alert" library setting.
    [3] In the OPAC, change locale and attempt to place a
        hold that would trigger the alert saying that there's
        already a local copy available.
    [4] Note that the alert reads as "Project-Id-Version: evergreen
        Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: ..."
    [5] Apply the patch.
    [6] Try step 3; this time the alert will be translated correctly,
        e.g., "Ve vaší domovské knihovně je již dostupný exemplář."

    When using a show_more_details.default setting of true in config.tt2,
    the Show More/Show Fewer Details button functionality is broken.  The
    detail record view is always shown, regardless of the button's state.
    This patch attempts to repair the behavior so that the user can toggle
    the detail record view even though the default is set to true.
