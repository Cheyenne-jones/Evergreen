    LP 1306666: Abort Transit Only Change Copy Status if In Transit
    
    When aborting a transit, the copy status is presently changed, either
    to the status stored in action.transit_copy or to Reshelving if the
    transit was for a hold.  This causes problems with "hanging" transits
    where something was not handled properly before.  We've had cases
    where a transit sticks around on a copy that is later checked out, and
    while that copy is checked out, the transit is aborted, thus setting
    the copy status to Reshelving when it should be Checked Out.
    
    The code change in this branch only changes the copy's status if it is
    In Transit.  A copy in any other status has its status left untouched.

    LP#1205492: fix crash when attempting to renew deposit & rental loans in OPAC
    
    This patch fixes a bug where attempting to renew a loan on an item
    that requires a deposit or a rental fee can cause an Apache
    internal server error.
    
    In particular, this patch supplies descriptions for the following
    events:
    
      ITEM_DEPOSIT_REQUIRED
      ITEM_RENTAL_FEE_REQUIRED
      ITEM_DEPOSIT_PAID
    
    It also normalizes how 'fail_part' is set in the renewal response,
    as the payload of an event returned when a renewal fails can
    be either a hash or an acp Fieldmapper object depending on the
    type of event.  In the former case, attempting to access an
    nonexistent ->fail_part method is what causes the crash.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create an item that requires a deposit or a rental fee
        and check it out.
    [2] Attempt to renew the loan in the public catalog. Note
        that an internal server error is returned.
    [3] Apply the patch and attept step 2 again. This time, the
        public catalog should display a notification to the patron
        that the renewal cannot take place, rather than crashing.
    [4] Set up other situations where a renewal should fail for
        reasons other than a deposit/rental fee being required. Verify
        that appropriate error messages are displayed in the public
        catalog.

    LP1559281: Allow Baker and Taylor Fake ISBNs
    
    For Content Cafe, jam two B&T entrys into the hash so that Business::ISBN
    doesn't register them as invalid prefix ISBNs.
    
    B&T uses internal ISBN's with country codes 630 and 631 for materials
    ordered through them when no assigned ISBN exists.  The ContentCafe
    added content service knows about these ISBNs, but they are not generally
    used by other providers.
    
    To Test:  This only works if you are using the ContentCafe added content provider.
    
     - Before Patch -
    1. Add the isbn 9786315820243 as the only isbn on a record. Remove UPCs also..
    2. Clear the added content cache by restarting memcached or using the staff link.
    3. View record in catalog and you should see no cover art.
    
     - After Patch -
    1. Clear the added content cache.
    2. View the record in the catalog and you should now see cover art for the title
    "Video games: the movie"
