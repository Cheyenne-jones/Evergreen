    LP#1526858: speed up queries for shelf-expired holds during checkin
    
    This patch adds indexes on action.hold_request and tweaks
    the definition of the alhr IDL view to more efficiently
    identify holds that can be canceled if the "Clear Holds Shelf"
    checkin modifier is in use.  This can prevent a problem
    where such checkins can time out in very large databases.
    
    The tweaks were created by Jason Etheridge and have been in
    production at a large consortium for some time.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] With a suitably large database, set up an item that
        is on the holds shelf but has passed its shelf-expiration
        time, then check it in using the "Clear Holds Shelf" modifier.
    [2] The checkin may fail with a "network failure" message due
        the query on the alhr timing out.
    [3] Apply the patch and repeat step 1. This time, the checkin
        should succeed.

    LP#1566016: remove SSN as a stock ident type
    
    This patch removes the SSN (Social Security Number) as a stock
    patron identification type, as it is no longer recommended
    practice for libraries to store SSNs.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Verify that in a fresh installation of Evergreen that
        has this patch in place, that SSN is no longer listed
        as a patron identification type.

    LP 1548993: Restore Show More/Show Fewer Details button functionality.
    
    When using a show_more_details.default setting of true in config.tt2,
    the Show More/Show Fewer Details button functionality is broken.  The
    detail record view is always shown, regardless of the button's state.
    This patch attempts to repair the behavior so that the user can toggle
    the detail record view even though the default is set to true.

    LP#1373578: fix translatability of hold placement errors
    
    This patch fixes a circumstance where ->maketext() could be
    passed an empty string, causing it to emit the PO file header text
    rather than a desired string.
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Configure Evergreen to use a TPAC localization (e.g.,
        the Czech translation).
    [2] Enable the "Has Local Copy Alert" library setting.
    [3] In the OPAC, change locale and attempt to place a
        hold that would trigger the alert saying that there's
        already a local copy available.
    [4] Note that the alert reads as "Project-Id-Version: evergreen
        Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: ..."
    [5] Apply the patch.
    [6] Try step 3; this time the alert will be translated correctly,
        e.g., "Ve vaší domovské knihovně je již dostupný exemplář."

    LP#1584801: fix tagging of previous circs in metarecord search results
    
    This patch fixes a bug where previously-checked-out items were not
    indicated as such in search results when doing a metarecord search.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Ensure that the opac.search.tag_circulated_items library setting
        is enabled and that you are testing with a user that has opted-in
        to retaining circ history.
    [2] Make a couple loans to that user.
    [3] Log into the public catalog using that user.
    [4] Perform a catalog search, choosing search terms such that
        the previously-loaned items appear in results.
    [5] Verify that "I have checked this item out before" is displayed
        on the relevant hits.
    [6] Click the "Group Formats and Editions" checkbox; note that
        after the page refreshes, previously-borrowed hits are /not/
        tagged.
    [7] Apply the patch and restart the open-ils.search service.
    [8] Repeat step 6; verify that this time previously-borrowed hits
        are tagged.

    LP#1517556 - Exclude inactive event defs from find_event_def_by_hook.
    
    Currently when find_event_def_by_hook is called to find an appropriate
    event_def based on the hook, it doesn't exclude inactive event defs.  So
    strange behavior can happen if inactive event defs are present.
    
    I ran into this issue when I was trying out different versions of the self
    check receipt event def.  I had one ative and one inactive while I was
    troubleshooting, and when the system would grab the inactive event def by
    chance, the self check UI would freeze.  I think it is a resonable expectation
    that an event def marked inactive doesn't get used by the system.
    
    To test this out, clone one of the self check event defs, such as
    "Self-Checkout Items Out Receipt" and mark the copy as inactive.  Now
    go and trigger this event in the self check interface by attempting to
    print from the Items Out screen.  It should now fail 50% of the time, since
    both the active and inactive defs are returned.
    
    After the fix the inactive event def will always be excluded, so the action
    should no longer fail.
