    LP 1708728 - Fix Stripe penny errors introduced by perl int() function
    
    Fixes the issue where payment amounts sent to Stripe can be one cent less
    than the actual Evergreen payment due to use of the perl int() function.
    
    To test
    -------
    A Stripe account is required to view transactions on the Stripe side.
    To enable test payments, Stripe testing API keys need to be entered
    in the Evergreen ou settings:
    
    credit.processor.stripe.pubkey
    credit.processor.stripe.secretkey
    
    - Add a bill to a patron record with the following amounts: $8.20
    - Login to the opac as the patron and pay the bill.
    - View the transaction on the Stripe side and see that it is one cent
      less than the paid bill in Evergreen.
    - Apply the patch.
    - Repeat the steps above.
    
    - On the Stripe side, see that the Stripe amount and Evergreen amount
      now match.

    LP#1710747: Absolute URL for media_prefix in templates
    
    If OILSWebMediaPrefix is set in the Apache configuration, then
    the ctx.media_prefix TT2 template variable uses that value as the
    hostname; otherwise it is null, resulting in many relative URLs for
    images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
    
    Normally this is not a problem, but the Open Graph image property
    requires a full absolute URL rather than the relative URL that would
    previously result on the record summary page in the absence of the
    OILSWebMediaPrefix variable having been set in the Apache config.
    
    This patch tweaks the EGWeb handler to fall back to the base hostname in
    the absence of the OILSWebMediaPrefix variable, thus ensuring that all
    uses of ctx.media_prefix result in an absolute URL.
    
    Test Plan:
    Pre-patch - Visit a record summary page in the catalog. View the source of the
    page. In the head section, find the og:image meta property. The content will
    display a relative URL to the record's book jacket cover image.
    
    Post-patch - When viewing the source of the page, og:image will display the
    full URL.

    LP#1669534 - OPAC hold request should not default to first SMS carrier
    
    Added empty <option> tag to address this and related form validation issues.
    
    To test
    -------
    [0] Ensure that SMS messaging is enabled.
    [1] Apply the patch and go to the place hold form in the public
        catalog. Verify that no mobile carrier is selected.
    [2] Set the default SMS carrier and number for the user account
        and go back to the place hold form. Verify that the user's
        default carrier and number appear in the form.

    LP#1706148 - Hide "Hold is behind Circ Desk" checkbox in XUL patron registration.
    
    When the library setting for "Behind Desk Pickup Supported" is not enabled then
    the checkbox for "Hold is behind Circ Desk" should be hidden.
    
    Test Plan - before fix:
      1. Check to make sure that the "Behind Desk Pickup Supported" library setting is
         unset or false.
      2. Open the patron registration screen in the XUL staff client and see that the
         user settings checkbox for "Hold is behind Circ Desk" exists.
    
    After Fix Applied:
      1. Check to make sure that the "Behind Desk Pickup Supported" library setting is
         unset or false.
      2. Open the patron registration screen in the XUL staff client and see that the
         user settings checkbox for "Hold is behind Circ Desk" no longer is shown.
      3. Change the library setting in question to True.
      4. Reload/reopen the patron registration screen and see that the checkbox now
         is visible.
