	basic/consistent profiles for documentation purposes.  1. Match-Only Merge This is a no-op merge.  It's only purpose is to allow Vandelay,
	which requires a profile of some sort to do anything, to find
	matching records.  This is useful for importing holdings when the
	MARC from the source record is not desired.  It will also be useful
	in the (forthecoming) Vandelay-driven Acquisitions lineitem linking (LP
	pending).  The target/incumbent record is not affected.  2. Full Overlay Used for overlaying an entire inbound MARC record over its target
	record.  The target/incumbent record is completely replaced by the
	inbound record.  For both, 901c is used because it's automatically updated on the
	target record to match the internal ID, regardless of any field
	preservation/stripping.  Signed-off-by: Bill Erickson <berick@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/vandelay/vandelay.js: Vandelay: refresh
	upload and inspect queue pages Vandley sub-pages are currently managed as hidden divs that come
	into view when the requested tab is selected.  This creates two
	types of problems in the interface.  The first is that newly created
	data (e.g. a new queue) is not available in the UI, because it's not
	getting re-fetched from the server when the tab is opened (or added
	to local data stores).  Second, certain form elements misbehave when
	the form is re-rendered without a refresh.  Elements, typically
	checkboxes, will appear to be selected when they are not.  (Or,
	perhaps they are, and the method to detect their selection is not
	sufficient).  The simplest solution to both problems is to simply
	reload the page....  This patch changes the tabs for Import Records and Inspect Queue so
	that they reload the page (focused on the selected tab) instead of
	just showing the hidden div.  These pages were chosen because they
	are the only interfaces that don't automatically refresh their own
	data and (for Import Record) have forms that need refreshing.  Additionally, since the user may spend more time loading Vandelay
	pages, this also fixes the long-standing annoyance of seeing the
	Vandelay UI partially render while waiting for the page to load.
	Now, it all remains hidden, except for a brief "Loading..." message.  Signed-off-by: Bill Erickson <berick@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	flag when linking a Limit Group to a Limit Set.  Both the limit groups and circ modifiers are linked to "Limit Sets"
	that act similarly to rules. Each Set can be attached to 0 or more
	circulation matchpoints.  Each Limit set supports a number of items out (0 replaces infinite),
	depth in the org tree to start counting at (0 for up to the top, 1
	for 1 below, etc), and a global flag (to check everywhere below the
	depth point, rather than just those circulations that happend at
	ancestors/descendants).  When a Limit Set is linked to a Circulation Matchpoint it can be
	made inactive and has a fallthrough flag. When the fallthrough flag
	is enabled the Limit Set will be used whenever the matchpoint is
	involved with making a decision. When it is disabled the Limit Set
	will only be used when the matchpoint is the most specific
	matchpoint used in making the decision.  Limit Groups management can be found on the server administration
	menu.  Limit Sets management can be found on the local administration menu.  Limit Set -> Matchpoint linking is done via editing Circulation
	Policies.  The upgrade script does not remove the old tables in case something
	goes wrong with migrating the information contained within them.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Berezansky <tsbere@mvlc.org> Conflicts: 	Open-ILS/web/opac/locale/en-US/lang.dtd 	Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/chrome/content/main/menu_frame_menus.xul Signed-off-by: Jason Stephenson <jstephenson@mvlc.org>

	docs/TechRef/AutoSuggest/README: AutoSuggest Get an autocompleting dialog underneath basic search boxes.  If activated, the dialog appears in both the JavaScript OPAC and the
	Template Toolkit OPAC.  Mike Rylander and Bill Erickson largely designed and spec'ed out
	this feature, especially at the database level.  Lebbeous
	Fogle-Weekley and Mike Rylander did the programming.  How it works, for site administrators
	------------------------------------- Once the code is installed, including database stored procedures, (re)ingesting your bibliographic records will populate two new
	tables needed by AutoSuggest: metabib.browse_entry and
	metabib.browse_entry_def_map.  Yes, for now this means that the size of your database in per-record
	terms will be greater.  The browse_entry data we generate is
	extremely similar to facet data, so it's possible that in the future
	we can blend them into the same thing at the database level, and
	save some space.  To control what gets indexed in the metabib.browse_* tables, set the
	boolean 'browse_field' column for each row in config.metabib_field
	as desired Numbers 15 (keyword|keyword) and 16 (subject|complete)
	should generally be set to false.  The config.metabib_class  table has a new 'bouyant' column.  Setting
	this to true means that when a user is typing in the OPAC search box
	with a search class selector set to, say, 'Subject', and the cmc row
	for 'Subject' has 'bouyant' set to true, the top suggestions will
	definitely come from the Subject fields of MARC records (if any).
	'restrict' is like 'bouyant', only stronger.  In that case
	suggestions /only/ come from the selected class.  This is the idea behind the 'restrict' column (in both the
	config.metabib_class table and the config.metabib_field table): For
	any given class or field, if restrict is true AND the user at the
	OPAC has selected that same class or field from the search class
	dropdown, then autosuggestions will only come from that class or
	field in the record.  You never want this column to be true for keyword, because we don't
	index keywords for browse/autosuggest purposes (we would get giant
	blobs of information as autosuggestions, and you don't want that
	(really)).  You don't really want it to be true for most classes and fields.  If
	the user sets the dropdown to "subject" and start typing "harry
	potter", the user really wants matches from the "title" class too
	(although other things being equal, matches from the "subject" class
	will rise to the top).  If you have a speciality index, you *may* want to set restrict to
	true for that particular field.  For a song title index, for
	example.  To take advantage of this, you would also have to
	customize your OPAC to have an entry in the search class dropdown
	for 'title|songtitle' (or whatever's appropriate for your specialty
	index).  This is easy to do and should be covered somewhere in
	documentation for both the JSPAC and the TPAC.  The order of suggestions otherwise has mostly to do with how well
	what users have typed matches what's in your bib records, and the
	value of the weight column of the relevant config.metabib_field row.
	Examine the code if you're curious to know more or want to make
	adjustments.  The master on/off switch for AutoSuggest is a new row in in
	config.global_flag named 'opac.use_autosuggest'.  Set its 'enabled'
	column to false to turn off AutoSuggest.  If you don't want your
	suggestions to be limited to whatever's OPAC visible at the search
	org, set the 'value' column to anything that does not contain the
	string 'opac_visible'.  This could be a good idea if AutoSuggest
	seems slow on a large site.  Turning this on means introducing Dojo in your TPAC.  I tried to
	keep it minimal, for load time's sake.  There's no fieldmapper or
	IDL stuff play.  For now, turning this feature off will avoid
	loading Dojo in your TPAC.  Managing the little stuff ------------------------- CSS classes that
	    affect the look of suggestions are in this file for the TPAC:
	Open-ILS/web/css/skin/default/opac/style.css and in this file for the JSPAC:     Open-ILS/web/opac/skin/default/css/layout.css At bottom, autosuggest is shaped by PostgreSQL's Full Text Search
	features.  Some of the arguments that are passed to TS_RANK_CD() and
	TS_HEADLINE() are expoposed via options to the
	openils.widget.AutoSuggest and openils.AutoSuggestStore modules,
	which have comments.  You can customize your OPAC files to invoke
	these with your desired options without touching much actual code.  Signed-off-by: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	table per row for each result, enclosing one further table per
	result for the attributes such as call number / publisher / edition
	that have been chosen to be displayed in the simple and detailed
	views.  The column widths for each search result row were being calculated
	per result, with the effect that title columns were starting at
	different offsets - a rather unpolished effect.  By eliminating the middle table, we can let the widths be determined
	by all of the search result rows together, providing a normalized
	result as the HTML deities intended.  We also move some inline CSS into style.css.  Note that IE 7, at least, ignores the :nth-child() usage to deliver
	the borders; because we no longer wrap the set of rows (including
	optional Content Cafe and ChiliFresh rows) in an intermediate table,
	we had to switch to a border-top attribute. We could have gone with
	a straight "tr > td" approach, but that would have added a line at

	SYS1 has available copies, clicking "(Show)" beside the SYS1
	available copy count will change the search scope to SYS1 and

	physical copies to display (for example, if there are located URIs
	that make the copy show up in search results).  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dan@coffeecode.net> Signed-off-by: Bill

	these cases where the chosen location / query / query type was being
	dropped: * Switching between account preferences * Creating / deleting / sharing / editing bookbags * Moving items from temporary list to bookbags * Adding notes to items in a bookbag * Placing holds The primary mechanism for forms is the "preserve_params.tt2" block

	standing penalty against the user, for staff to notice next time
	they bring up said patron in the staff client.  Such penalties will
	be archived whenever that patron's email address or phone number is
	updated again.  The middle layer method is a wrapper around a method that may take
	different parameters (like an email address instead of a patron ID)
	to potentially support future uses such as invalidating email
	addresses automatically in batch.  Signed-off-by: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	texting For SMS functionality we're basically converting a carrier and a
	phone number into an email address and sending via SMTP like other
	email notifications.  There is administrative UI for configuring
	these mappings:     Admin -> Server Settings -> SMS Carriers The permission ADMIN_SMS_CARRIER is needed to use this interface. In
	a stock Evergreen installation, this is given to the Global
	Administrator group.  In this interface, any occurance of "$number" in the Email Gateway
	field will change into the pertinent SMS phone number when the
	mapping gets used. We're not doing anything fancy here for verifying
	or munging phone numbers, but you could do munging in the pertinent
	SMS Action/Trigger templates, or better, contribute code for the
	OPAC templates and/or the utility method get_sms_gateway_email in
	Trigger/Reactor.pm.  Our set of stock mappings comes from
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways There's no automated process for keeping this up-to-date, though
	some volunteer with a Wikipedia account could add the page to their
	watchlist for changes and let us know if something needs changing.  Set the org unit setting "SMS: Enable features that send SMS text
	messages." (database name "sms.enable") to True to expose the
	following:   * SMS notification widgets in the TT-OPAC hold placement interface
	    (to notify when a hold is ready for pickup)   * "(SMS)" links next to call numbers on the TT-OPAC record details
	    page. The interface spawned by these links require user
	    authentication by default, but this can be changed by setting the
	    org unit setting "SMS: Disable auth requirement for texting call
	    numbers." to True. The database name for that setting is
	"sms.disable_authentication_requirement.callnumbers".    * New options in TT-OPAC My Account -> Account Preferences ->
	    Notification Preferences (we also add in some missing prefs for
	holds outside of SMS) There are two pertinent Action/Trigger templates under Admin ->
	Local Administration -> Notifications / Action Triggers:   * SMS Call Number   * Hold Ready for Pickup SMS Notification Don't disable these. We rely on the sms.enable YAOUS as the master
	on/off switch.  Also, it's probably best to have just one sms.enable for the whole
	consortium.  If you mix and match on/off settings here, then user
	preferences for SMS can get blown away if the user updates their
	settings in the TT-OPAC at an org where SMS is disabled.  Hrmm, the
	same would probably happen if the user jumps between the TT-OPAC and
	the original JS-PAC.  Signed-off-by: Jason Etheridge <jason@esilibrary.com>

	to 5pm: sudo date --set 17:00:00 Stop Evergreen, Restart Postgres, Start Evergreen On the client: Make sure the timezone is set to Pacific time.  1) Change the Library Setting "Default hold shelf expire interval"
	in the Holds group to have a value of "7 days" (without the quotes)
	for org BR1 (or if there is an existing value, you can keep it).  2) Create a bib with one item: htest1  (Status of Available) 3) Place a title level hold on the bib 4) Check in htest1 (it should get captured for the hold) 5) Browse the Hold Shelf and note the Shelf Expire Time for the hold
	that captured htest1 (it should be a week from now, unless you
	already have a conflicting closed date configured) 6) Cancel the hold and re-check-in htest1 (to remove the Hold Shelf
	status) 7) In the Closed Dates Editor, Add Single Day Closing for the date
	noticed previously in the Shelf Expire Time for BR1.  8) Place a title level hold on the bib 9) Check in htest1 (it should get captured for the hold) 10) Browse the Hold Shelf and note the Shelf Expire Time for the
	hold that captured htest1 (now the bug is illustrated if you get the
	same date for Shelf Expire Time as you did before, since that day is
	now a Closed Date and should be skipped over.  The patch should fix
	this.) Signed-off-by: Jason Etheridge <jason@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	Open-ILS/web/js/dojo/openils/widget/nls/PCrudFilterDialog.js: Major
	enhancements to openils.widget.PCrudFilterDialog openils.widget.PCrudFilterDialog is (now) a dijit that allows users
	to define inclusionary filters based on any number of rows that
	specify a field from a given fieldmapper class, an operator, and a
	value (or range of values, for the [not] between operator).  The
	resulting filter is suitable for use as the where clause of a pcrud
	search call.  AutoGrid has an option, showLoadFilter, that allows you to easily
	provide a filter dialog in any AutoGrid-based interface, with some
	minor caveats (see the comments at the top of the source for
	openils.widget.PCrudFilterDialog).  AutoGrid will also pass along
	the suppressFilterFields option, which works analagously to the
	suppressEditFields option.  You can also build your own interfaces
	to use this dijit without AutoGrid, if desired.  Signed-off-by: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/patron/display.js: More
	aggressive recalc of standing penalties In the staff client, the Refresh button in the patron display will
	explicitly ask the server to recalculate standing penalties for the
	patron. Other automatic refresh-like behavior meant to synchronize
	parts of the patron display will not do this.  This change tweaks the logic to ask for a recalculation with all
	refresh-like behavior in the patron display, and will catch such
	things as staff changing the user's permisssion profile.  An example of how you might test this: Admin -> Local Administration -> Group Penalty Thresholds New Penalty Threshold Group: Volunteers Org Unit: CONS Penalty: PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES
	Threshold: 1 Save Register user with Profile of Patrons Load patron, Bills, Bill Patron, Amount: 5, Submit this Bill Edit Main (Profile) Permission Group: Volunteers, Save The interface should refresh and show a Maximum Bills penalty in the
	patron summary.  Signed-off-by: Jason Etheridge <jason@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	in marc_export 852 $a is supposed to correspond to the institution holding the item
	from which access is given, according to the MARC Format for
	Holdings Data specification. As the org unit shortnames typically
	don't correspond to one of the MARC Code List for Organization
	entries, we've assumed that users will define the --location
	parameter; however, if that parameter isn't defined, the empty
	string is used and an empty subfield is generated. This, in turn,
	makes other MARC-parsing tools unhappy. So, only generate an 852 $a
	if we have an actual value for the --location parameter.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca> Signed-off-by: Mike

	search lib / depth settings The current TPAC code uses logic embedded within the templates to
	determine which org unit and depth to apply to searches.  This commit attempts to standardize the logic within the new
	OpenILS::WWWW::EGCatLoader::Util::_get_search_lib() function and
	sets the result as a new context variable, "search_ou". The org unit
	is determined as follows (first matching condition wins): * specific CGI "loc" value * logged-in user's preferred search library * logged-in user's home org unit * specific CGI "physical_loc" value The depth is set as follows (first matching condition wins): * specific CGI "depth" value * depth of the chosen org_unit As of this commit, a library that wishes to set the a default search
	org unit for any given user should set the "physical_loc" CGI param;
	after the user performs their first search, the "loc" CGI param will
	propagate through most interfaces. When a user clicks "Your account
	log in", the user's preferred search library or home org unit will
	be set as the new search lib.  At any time after that, the user can select a different org unit
	from the org unit selector to explicitly set the "loc" CGI param.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dan@coffeecode.net> Signed-off-by: Jason

	    need the noun "copies" but "available" has been factored out)   * Create a "Holds" header and move the holds information under
	  that * Put the "Available copies" and "Holds" into inline-block elements     so that they can take less vertical space on a wide screen but     will wrap on a narrow screen.    * Fix the line spacing between LI elements In addition, break up the lengthy summary TT2 file into a few
	smaller parts. In particular, make a copy_counts.tt2 file as sites
	are very likely to customize this to, in some cases, not show the
	consortial counts, or in other cases to only show the consortial
	count and current search library.  Also fix some horrible CSS issues in the header in which the "Place
	hold" and "Add to list" buttons were above the title / image, as
	well as remove some of the CSS manipulation to plain H2 elements

	Fix LP851000.  Remove about 14 lines from OpenILS/Application/Circ/Circulate.pm in
	the checkin_handle_circ subroutine that check whether or not the
	checkin happens at the copy's circ_lib and the value of the
	circ.lost_immediately_available org unit setting.  This change causes the handle_lost subroutine to run regardless of
	where the checkin takes place for a more consistent experience.  Whether or not billings are voided, overdues restored, etc. is still
	determined by the copy's circ_lib.  Given how the hold targeter and transit code works, it does not
	appear the the circ.lost_immediately_available setting could ever do
	what it was intended to do. Given these changes to the code it is
	now unnecessary.  Signed-off-by: Jason Stephenson <jstephenson@mvlc.org>

	Protect against missing 901c in legacy MARCXML Bad MARCXML to which Evergreen has been unable to add a 901c happens
	- particularly with legacy MARCXML. Currently, TPAC crashes hard
	with an ugly error if a 901c is not found when attempting to display
	the record in search results. In comparison, the JSPAC displays the
	record without a problem.  This commit logs a warning and enables the TPAC to continue somewhat
	gracefully (the problem record is simply skipped in the search
	results).  A more robust solution may be to teach unapi.bre to add
	the record ID to the results and to have the TPAC pull from that,
	rather than relying on the MARCXML itself to contain the record ID.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca> Signed-off-by: Bill

	LP896405: Address SQL upgrade issues getting to 2.2-alpha1 Martha Driscoll tried out the 2.2-alpha1 upgrade script and found a
	few problems noted in this thread:

	http://list.georgialibraries.org/pipermail/open-ils-dev/2011-November/007747.html"upgrade_log" does not exist > LINE 1: INSERT INTO
	config.upgrade_log (version, applied_to) VALUES .  This fails because the "applied_to" column does not exist at this
	point in the schema upgrade. Just remove the "applied_to" column
	from the INSERT statement.  This will probably fail because most sites won't have applied 0526
	to their production server, so move the statements outside of the
	transaction.  Also, in my own testing I ran into: public / evergreen function namespace issues we tried to address
	back in the 2.0(?) timeframe. New sites will have the is_json()
	function in the evergreen namespace, while old sites will have it in
	public, so we do _not_ qualify the function name and just let the

	switches to the new Google Books API (which is both imminent and
	also necessary to make SSL calls work).  Though the information is
	scant, from what I have read and experienced, we do not need an API
	key to do searches and previews.  I have also not hit any kind of
	unauthenticated limit in several days of heavy testing, so I would
	figure we are safe (at this point) for normal end-user OPAC
	browsing.  Second, all Google Book requests are now done over https.  This
	eliminates the majority of mixed content warnings when browsing
	securely, though you still get a warning when you actually do
	preview a book.  In addition to possibly implementing protocol detection (rather than
	doing https all the time as a "lowest" common denominator), there
	are a few minor points where we might consider future changes.
	Those points are commented within the code.  Signed-off-by: Dan Wells <dbw2@calvin.edu> Signed-off-by: Dan Scott

	Improvement for telephony: just-in-time event revalidation One of the shortcomings with using the Action/Trigger based
	telephony in Evergreen until now was that while you might have
	overdue notices generated and sent to a system where Asterisk runs
	for later calling, but if the notice was generated on a Saturday
	night, and you have Asterisk set up not to place any calls again
	until Monday morning, Asterisk has no way of revalidating that call
	at the last minute.  That is, the system could not determine whether
	the items that were overdue on Saturday night are still overdue on
	Monday morning, and whether the call should still be made.  Now we have a workable solution to that.  The eg-pbx-allocator.pl script, which takes call files for Asterisk
	from a "staging" directory and slowly drips them onto Asterisk's
	spool can now consult an open-ils.justintime which in turn asks
	open-ils.trigger whether given events, enumerated within the call
	files themselves, are still valid.  open-ils.trigger is designed to run as a private service, so that's
	why we need a public service that doesn't do anything too sensitive.  This open-ils.justintime service can potentially be extended to
	offer other just-in-time information to the allocator right before a
	call goes onto Asterisk's spool. For example, that might be a good
	time to check the time of day and make a late decision on which
	phone number to use for a given user (day_phone, evening_phone,
	other_phone).  Signed-off-by: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	library to Consortium and the depth filter to the lowest depth,
	which would normally show all libs, but then use the checkbox to

	* Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/actor/user/register.js: Patch from Jeff
	Davis (SITKA) fixing cardless patron updates Quoth the bug report
	(https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/851110):   On our Evergreen 2.0.8 system, it sometimes arises that a patron's
	  card gets deleted. If it was the patron's only card, it becomes
	  impossible to add a new card to the account via the staff client.    How to reproduce:   1. Retrieve a patron record for a patron who has no associated
	  card.  2. Click the Edit button.    3. Click Replace Barcode and enter a new barcode.    4. Click Save. This does not work - the process hangs, and if you
	  hit Reload, you will find that your changes were not saved.    I believe this happens because some code in register.js assumes
	  the patron has at least one card. I have a potential fix that this
	  comment box is too small to contain ... uh, that is to say, I will
	  post it momentarily.  Which he did, and I applied.  Signed-off-by: Mike Rylander <mrylander@gmail.com>

	LP825039: Add reingest logic for non-filing titles Rather than reindexing all titles that have a non-filing indicator,
	this upgrade handles the known problematic cases (apostrophes with
	leading articles). On our system that's 55K out of 2.2M records -
	not bad at all.  We also ensure the format is set to MODS32 for title:proper, as
	sites might have customized it on a MARC basis and we don't want to
	reindex the records with NULL values due to a mix of format and
	XPath.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca>

	not a problem in English with leading articles like "The" and "A"
	which are followed by spaces anyway, but a significant problem for
	French where "L'année" is not supposed to be turned into "L'
	année".  To combat this, we define a titleNonfiling variant in the MODS32
	stylesheets that ignores the second indicator and does not wrap
	leading articles in the nonSort element, avoiding the injection of
	unwanted spaces.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca>

	of that kind of search.  It's possible to get lineitems onto that list that are in a state
	other than "new".  Code that deletes this list first deletes the
	lineitems that belong to it, but that code formerly assumed that
	there are two types of lineitems. "new" ones (that should be
	deleted) and ones that belong to purchase orders (that should be
	deatched).  That doesn't necessarily cover all possible lineitems on
	the picklist, so deletion ultimately fails.  This fixes that.  [update: now this bugfix incorporates a bugfix, the need for which
	was detected by Ben Shum. See LP #869581] Signed-off-by: Lebbeous Fogle-Weekley <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	period auto extension and backdate awareness Grace period auto extension: Default is "grace periods don't auto extend".  OU setting turns on grace period auto extension. By default they
	only do so when the grace period ends on a closed date, but there
	are two modifiers to change that.  The first modifier causes grace periods to extend for all closed
	dates that they intersect. This is "grace periods are only consumed
	by open days." The second modifier causes a grace period that ends just before a
	closed day, with or without extension having happened, to include
	the closed day (and any following it) as well. This is mainly so
	that a backdate into the closed period following the grace period
	will assume the "best case" of the item having been returned after
	hours on the last day of the closed date.  Backdate grace period awareness: By moving grace period calculations into a shared location
	backdating can check the grace period, including extensions. If it
	finds that the backdate is within the grace period (before or after
	extension) then instead of voiding the fines for after the backdate
	it instead voids all fines for the circulation. This emulates what
	would have happened (no fines) if the item had been checked in at
	the time the backdate was made to take effect.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Berezansky <tsbere@mvlc.org> Signed-off-by:

	Open-ILS/src/sql/Pg/upgrade/XXXX.schema.located_uri_visiblity_fix.s
	ql: Correct Located URI visiblity Located URIs should be visible when they exist at the search context
	org unit or an ancestor thereof.  However, before the change
	embodied in this commit, they effectively acted exactly like copies,
	making records visible anywhere within the context+depth range.  An example, using the stock example OU hierarchy:  * Before this change, a Located URI with an owner of BR1 would
	 cause its record to show up in a search at (or scoped to via a
	depth parameter) BR1, SYS1 or CONS.   * Before this change, a Located URI with an owner of SYS1 would NOT
	 cause its record to show up in a search at (or scoped to via a
	depth parameter) BR1!  * After this change, a Located URI with an owner of BR1 will cause
	 its record to show up only in a search with a context OU of BR1,
	irrespective of depth scoping.   * After this change, a Located URI with an owner of SYS1 WILL cause
	 its record to show up in a search with a context OU of BR1 or SYS1,
	regardless of depth scoping.  Signed-off-by: Mike Rylander <mrylander@gmail.com> Signed-off-by:

	allowed the receipt printer to print UTF-8 characters.  I used the
	ideas in that fix to modify spine_labels.js.  In spine_labels.js,
	the url passed to the preview in preview_xul_192 was encoding the

	LP857460: Get the generic class scheme when adding vols In a default Evergreen instance, in the "Add Volumes" interface for
	a bib record with both LC and Dewey call numbers, the list of call
	numbers from which you can select appears to be limited to Dewey,
	even though the "Bib Call #" field is populated with an LC call
	number.  The problem is that here we're grabbing the first entry from the
	asset.call_number_classification table, and you might expect that to
	be the "Generic" entry - however, it turns out to be the "Dewey"
	entry because the entries are ordered alphabetically by .name(), not
	by database ID. (You can test this be changing the name of "Dewey"
	to "Vicious" and see that the "Generic" entry is chosen instead).  This commit changes the process to first search the acnc array for a
	name() = "Generic"; and then if we don't find that, fall back to the
	first entry in the classification scheme.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca> Signed-off-by: Dan

	instead of into transit when in effect. Non-hold transits should not
	check it. This should be useful when multiple parts of a library
	share a hold shelf, but are split on the org tree.  circ.transit.suppress_non_hold will cause items to reshelve instead
	of going into transit. Hold transits should not check it. This
	should be useful when multiple parts of a library are in the same

	the EDIFACT output anyhow, and will just confound the translator.  This commit also pre-escapes quotation marks in lineitem attributes
	so that we don't produce invalid JSON for our JEDI.  This commit also destroys the death star.  Seriously, the right way to fix some of the issues people have had
	is for somebody to learn Ruby and to address them either in

	Current Bills thinks it is Bill History This fixes LP 855894: Bills interface calls itself Bill History,
	uses bills_historical receipt template https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/855894 At some point in development, the Current Bills and the Bill History
	interface were in a unified file, with an xul_param of "current"
	used to switch between the two.  Nothing currently sets the xul_param "current", so the Current Bills
	interface (bill2.xul and bill2.js) was improperly: * not hiding the xact_finish column * using a caption label of "Bill History" * using the bills_historical receipt template The Bill History interface was okay -- "not current" was the
	default.  This commit removes the tests for xul_param('current') and uses the
	appropriate code for each interface.  // this code in both bill2.js and bill_history.js: var template =
	'bills_historical'; if (xul_param('current')) template =
	'bills_current'; // becomes: var template = 'bills_current';    // in bill2.js var

	<input type="submit"> buttons. The payoff is directly translatable
	values and better semantics for screen readers, etc, rather than
	having to set up a process of generating buttons in your colour &
	languages of choice - as well as fewer HTTP requests for images over
	the network.  Note that we also replace some of the JavaScript-dependent reset /
	cancel links with <input type="reset"> buttons.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dscott@laurentian.ca>

	lizer.sql: Generic mapping index normalizer Useful for mapping values extracted for SVF
	(metabib.record_attr.attrs) attributes to alternate values.  For
	example, you can map collections of MARC Audience codes into groups
	of codes for to create audience groups.  This normalizer takes a text parameter (in addition to the extracted
	value) that defines a simple mapping between input and output.  Each
	mapping consists of one or more comma separated strings on the left
	of a separator (called the source group), a separator, and a
	alphanumeric string to the right of the separator (called the
	mapping target). The format of a mapping is:   {string}[,{string}][..]=>{non-whitespace-string} For example:   a,b,c=>X Multiple mappings can be supplied, separated by whitespace.  Each
	mapping itself is not sensitive to most whitespace.  For instance,
	the following are all equivalent:  a,b,c=>X  a, b, c => X     a   ,   b   ,   c    =>     X In each, "a", "b" and "c" are mapped to "X", and anything else is
	returned without mapping.  Additionionally, whitespace within a string in the source group is
	tolerated.  Given a mapping of:   a e i o u, y, w => V The string "a e i o u", "y" or "w" will return "V".  In addition to explicit mapping, an empty source group will produce
	a default mapping, where anything not matching another mapping will
	return the mapping target.  For instance, given the following:   =>X a,b,c=>Y An input of "b" will return "Y" and an input of "k" will return "X".
	The Default mapping target may be the same as the mapping target
	with an explicit source group.  For instance, the following can be
	interperated as "map a, b and c to X, map 1, 2, 3 and anything we
	don't know about to Y":  a,b,c=>X 1,2,3=>Y =>Y As a practical example, simplifying the audience values in MARC
	fixed fields to three groups and using those values in a new coded
	value map would allow one to create a dynamically populated search
	interface that uses more patron- friendly terms.  For instance:   a,b,j=>K c,d=>T a=>A =>A g=>E The above makes the assumption that Unknown, Specialized and Not
	Coded should be lumped in with Audult, just to be safe, and General
	is for (E)veryone.  Signed-off-by: Mike Rylander <mrylander@gmail.com> Signed-off-by:

	hour, the first fine should be eligible for generation at 2:01pm. As
	it stands, the first fine does not generate until an entire fine
	period has elapsed, so in this case, 3:00pm.  The previous version of the code had a special case for day-

	Open-ILS/src/templates/vandelay/vandelay.tt2: Remove /default/ from
	template paths The original goal of having a /default/ component to the template
	path was to support alternate skins.  However, Template Toolkit
	supports alternate skins through a more elegant mechanism of
	providing template overlays via template path configuration.  In
	other words, skin files will be differentiated by the location of
	their root path and not because they live in a different skin
	directory inside the main template root.  Because of this, the /default/ component in the template path serves
	no purpose and generally just gets in the way.  As a part of this, EGWeb.pm no longer inserts the skin name into the
	template file path.  Signed-off-by: Bill Erickson <berick@esilibrary.com>

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/chrome/content/util/print.js: Receipt
	Macros: %INCLUDE()% Takes a single parameter: The name of the include.  Each include is an OU setting: circ.staff_client.receipt.<name> The includes are done as the first substitution. This has the
	benefit of allowing other substitutions within them (including
	additional calls to %INCLUDE()%) and the downside of not allowing
	dynamic includes.  Because an include can contain includes the code keeps track of all
	includes already done, skipping those already included. This
	prevents infinite loops when A includes B and B includes A, or
	longer variants thereof.  Primary intended use would be for libraries to place frequently
	changed notices and such in their templates. Instead of having to
	edit every template on every workstation they use the %INCLUDE()%
	macro and edit the org unit settings. At the next login the updated
	text appears on every workstation.  Due to the includes being processed first a library could use them
	to centrally administer templates by using an include for each piece
	of each template.  Signed-off-by: Thomas Berezansky <tsbere@mvlc.org> Signed-off-by:

	would freeze.  An example of such a search would be: Climate change
	economics and policy : an RFF anthology This was happening because
	the decompose function within QueryParser.pm Would build a regular
	expression that would search the query for both classes and class
	aliases e.g (keyword and kw).  However, when buliding the regex for
	aliases QueryParser would add extraneous or symbols (|) to the end
	of the regex without adding the accompanying alias.  This was
	happening because there was a check to see if the corresponding
	class to each alias had already been added to the regex.  But, the
	check to see if the alias had already been appened to the regex
	happened too late.  I have moved the check to encopase the appending
	of the or symbols and the class.  Signed-off-by: Liam Whalen

	org_lasso search is broken Fix the JavaScript error when we attempt to create a feed for the

	lets the request hit the backend Perl module, which in turn chokes
	on a test for OU that only allows two conditions: either all digits
	is treated as a numeric ID for an org unit, or it is a shortname. Of
	course, lassos are negative integers, so we have to modify the test
	slightly to make it happier.  There was no depth for org lasso copy counts, and this was handled
	correctly in the main case by the
	asset.opac_lasso_record_copy_count() function and its staff variant,
	but when a copy was not found at a given org_unit in the lasso a

	Item Editor We're trying to prevent folks from using the item attribute editor
	in the unified interface when the volume pane is still updating its
	information (i.e. building the copies to feed to the attribute
	editor), so that a given editing widget isn't ripped out from under
	staff while its being used.  This change removes the heavy-handed
	Ready Item Editor button and instead tries to more gracefully manage
	the editor state based on change and keypress events.  Also change
	the color scheme for a disabled editor from red to light pink.  Signed-off-by: Jason Etheridge <jason@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	    problems with the regular expression in db-seed-i18n.py)   * authority.js includes Unicode values (shock!) and so we must

	Faster T-pac circ history retrieval * Take advantage of the new default sorting behavior of
	action.usr_visible_circs to perform limit/offset within the DB
	instead of fetching the whole circ history in the mod_perl code and
	sorting through it.  * Also use the  more powerful/verbose column transform syntax for
	calling stored procedures to retrieve only the historical circ IDs
	instead of the full circ objects, since we are re-fetching fleshed
	circ objects later in the code.  Signed-off-by: Bill Erickson <berick@esilibrary.com>

	remembered templates kept applying themselves whenever changes were
	made in the volume/copy creator portion of the interface (possibly

	without making any allowance that the test might be run from

	field are not populated with a 003 field. This resulted in the OCLC
	number being thrown away entirely, rather than being moved into the
	035, as there was no corresponding control number identifier field.  However, given that we know that control numbers starting with "ocm"
	or "ocn" are special OCLC numbers, we can generate the 035
	accordingly even in the absence of a 003. This update to
	maintain_control_numbers() teaches it to do the right thing for OCLC
	numbers.  In addition, add an identifier search index so we can easily find

	MFHD compressed holding fixes 1. Add new utility method to MFHD.pm:     holdings_by_caption(): return all holdings attached to a     given caption 2. Add 'passthru_open_ended' option to get_decompressed_holdings()     Previously, attempts to decompress an open-ended holding     would error out.  Now, in the absence of this option,     open-ended holdings are discarded and you get a warning     (since they cannot logically be decompressed), while if     this option is 'true' they are passed back unaffected 3. compressed_to_last() on an open-ended holding now more    correctly returns 'undef' rather than the unaltered holding 4. get_compressed_holdings() will now honor an open-ended holding    by treating it as "infinite", and thus absorbing any holdings    which would follow 5. Overloaded comparison operator now correctly detects "swap"    cases (where only the second operand is a holding) 6. Overloaded comparison operator now consistently treats    open-ended holdings as "greater-than" a single or closed    holding which has the same starting point 7. Fix 2 thinkos in comparison operator for overlapping    compressed holdings 8. Add new compressed_end() method to Holding.pm which can add    or set a new ending to a holding, making compressed if needed 9. Correctly recognize partially compressed holdings     If a holding is defined as:         863 40 $81.1 $a1 $b2-10     this actually means:         863 40 $81.1 $a1-1 $b2-10     so let's make sure to treat it that way.  9. Expand the MFHD test suite to better cover the improvements    in this commit There is also the beginnings of a _get_truncated_holdings() method
	for handling odd cases where an open-ended holding is followed by a
	single/closed holding, but it is currently commented out, pending
	further design consideration.  Signed-off-by: Dan Wells <dbw2@calvin.edu>

	is attempted at a given pickup lib, if either of those settings are
	true in the context of said pickup lib, and there are copies in an
	available status at the pickup lib already, inform the user before
	placing the hold.  In the alert case, the user can place the hold
	anyway with another click.  In the block case, there's an end on't.

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Application/Search.pm: Make
	spell-checking case insensitive As it stands, if you search for a proper noun using lower case, but
	manage to trigger the "did you mean" functionality, all the words
	are 'corrected' even if just the case is wrong.  However, we are
	stripping out the best correction precisely because it is the same
	word, different case.  It is a bit confusing to explain, but here is
	an example: daniel potatoe gets corrected to: Daniela potato This happens because the current spell check is case sensitive, so
	'daniel' is spelled wrong, but then we remove 'Daniel' from the list
	of corrections (presumably to avoid possibly suggesting terms which
	would yield the same exact result set).  So, we either need to make the spell-check itself case insensitive,
	or stop removing the re-cased corrections.  Since the catalog search
	itself is already case-insensitive, I think it makes sense that the
	spell check should follow suit.  Signed-off-by: Dan Wells <dbw2@calvin.edu> Signed-off-by: Mike

2011-04-22  senator <lebbeous@esilibrary.com>

	* Open-ILS/web/js/dojo/openils/vandelay/TreeDndSource.js,
	Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/conify/global/vandelay/match_set.js: some
	changes in the UI to reflect DB side changes Negation and quality are now ignored for operator nodes, and are not
	settable in the UI.  Also in the UI, you can no longer replace the root node of the tree
	with a non-op node, meaning the root of a tree is always AND or OR.  This is due to some bug that hangs the UI now when you try to save a
	single-non-op-node tree, and it's not worth debugging: just remove
	the feature.

	* Open-ILS/web/templates/default/opac/parts/record/summary.tt2: 
	Don't display located URIs in record details copy table The more correct approach would be to modify the JSON query to
	exclude copies from volumes where label = '##URI##', or to cut over
	to the in-db unapi-based xml_holdings + acp approach - but for now
	this is a quick and dirty fix that can't possibly hurt.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dan@coffeecode.net>

	copy display in search results Even though we were trying to root our findnodes() call at a
	specific point in the DOM, the XPath was retrieving all volume
	elements in the entire DOM and we were therefore getting duplicate
	items listed in the search results. Accordingly, use the volume ID
	to root the search to the specific volume.  Also, offer designers a bit more of an opportunity to style the
	holdings by placing them in a table as well. Bonus points for using

	    with the value of 856 $y, however, it was getting populated with
	    856 $u - perhaps as a result of the ordering of array entries in
	    XPATH() not matching the XPath expression. Instead of including 856
	    $u in the XPath expression for uri_label, just assign its value to
	    uri_label if uri_label is otherwise NULL.      Per 797307: biblio.extract_located_uris() tries to reuse an
	    existing active asset.uri entry rather than create a new row;
	    however, it does not handle the case where there is no public note
	    aka "use restriction" and will end up creating a duplicate row every
	    time the record is reingested. Teach it to handle NULL values

	as dependencies. These conflict with the 9.0 versions that are
	required as dependencies for PostgreSQL 9.0 - so get them out of the
	way, pin the 9.0 versions of the packages, and reinstall
	apache2-prefork-dev.  We will probably need to do something similar for Lucid.  Signed-off-by: Dan Scott <dan@coffeecode.net>

	checkin interval setting OK, here's the situation, a copy went away on a week's vacation...  Support for preventing checkin of a copy that was put into transit
	"too recently".  The scenario that prompted the development is this: Copy at Branch A is checked in and put into transit to fill a hold
	at Branch B.  The copy is then accidentally checked in at Branch B.
	(Imagine a crate of items with a superbarcode gets checked in at
	Branch B and the copy in question was presumed to be in that crate).
	This puts the item on the holds shelf (assuming a hold transit) at
	Branch B and notifies the patrom the item is ready for pickup.
	However, the copy is still just embarking from Branch A.  This new setting allows libraries to configure a minimum transit
	time.  If a copy is put into transit and checked in during the
	configured interval, the checkin will return an (overridable) event
	that prevents checkin.  If the setting is not configured, this has
	no affect on checkin.  Signed-off-by: Bill Erickson <berick@esilibrary.com> Signed-off-by:

	with one major purpose being the generation of correct sort keys.
	You can also specify a default label class as an org unit setting.
	However: 1) There are no interface elements for setting the label class of an
	individual call number.  2) The default setting from the actor.org_unit_setting
	'cat.default_classification_scheme' value, if set, is not consulted
	(that is, not set in the call number table) when new call numbers
	are created.  These two facts together greatly reduce the utility of this very
	valuable feature, as all new call numbers end up in the 'Generic'
	class.  While #1 has been addressed in 2.1+, there is still work to be done
	in setting this class on import. Also, which interface parts (if
	any) make it back to 2.0 is subject to debate.  This commit addresses #2.  See lp #787150.  Signed-off-by: Dan Wells <dbw2@calvin.edu> Signed-off-by: Dan Scott

	* Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/cat/volume_copy_creator.js: 
	persist partial changes to new copies in vol/copy editor has new
	copies are gathered.  In other words, you can do something like enter 5 in the "# of
	Copies" field, enter the first barcode (say b1), edit an attribute
	(say, set Circulate = No), and then enter a second barcode (b2).
	Previously, the changes made to b1 would be lost as b2 was entered
	(or as other movement around the barcode entry textboxes happened)
	and both copies would get a Circulate = Yes, but now in this
	scenario, you would see 1 copy set to No and 1 copy set to Yes for
	the Circulate attribute.  Signed-off-by: Jason Etheridge <jason@esilibrary.com>

	* Open-ILS/web/templates/default/opac/parts/place_hold.tt2: Better
	redirect from place_hold Before this, if you click place hold on something while not logged
	in, you are redirected to the login page, which is good, and
	redirected thence to the place hold page, which is good. But after
	actually placing the hold you got redirected to the login page
	again, which is not good.  Now you get sent back to the home page.  This may not be the ideal choice.  myopac/main may make more sense.
	Also, there is still not any clear visual feedback for the user that
	their hold placement succeeded.  That'll need to be addressed too.

	http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp (and it

	then replacing "&" with "&amp;" we avoid this problem at the source.

	a subfield like "von Hans-Christian Müơller" - when this subfield
	was encountered without assume_unicode(1), a null string was

	User Editor / registration interface Per LP # 754898, the Register Patron interface currently contains
	many hardcoded strings. Given that the previous patron registration
	interface supported translation, this is a regression in 2.0.  Accordingly, we extend the use of Dojo i18n support to provide the
	strings for buttons and a number of labels on the Register Patron
	interface. The bulk of the remaining text is provided by the
	fieldmapper definitions, which should in theory be translated
	automatically for us.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20298

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Application/Circ/Holds.pm: Use
	top level join instead of subquery in hold queue position query This is more readily optimized by the Postgres planer.  Note also, for very large data sets (lots of holds, on the order of
	100k+ active), the following is also advised:  ALTER TABLE action.hold_copy_map alter column target_copy SET
	 statistics 500, alter column hold set statistics 500; ANALYZE
	action.hold_copy_map; This gives the planner better data about the hold-copy-map
	n-distinct.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20221

	(URL) as a sort of last-gasp effort to give it some data. However,
	the effect was rather odd and led to workarounds like Conifer's skin
	to avoid displaying the use restriction field if its value was
	identical to the URL, etc.  Instead, stop grabbing $u and handle the case where use_restriction
	column is NULL gracefully, just like the schema intended.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20123

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/SuperCat.pm: Protect dumb
	JavaScript engines from having to deal with actual Unicode The holdings_xml format did not include an XML declaration, but
	adding that as we do here still does not make the Firefox and
	Chromium JS engines capable of consuming XML that contains Unicode
	content outside of the base ASCII range.  So, we invoke entityize() to convert anything outside of the realm
	of ASCII to XML entities. An alternative would be to invoke
	entityize() in OpenILS::Application::SuperCat::unAPI::acn but it's
	not clear if that would interfere with any other uses.  With this change, library names / copy location names with Unicode
	content can be displayed correctly on the search results page.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20112

	support for Multi-Homed Items (aka Foreign Bibs, aka Linked Items) Evergreen needs to support the ability to attach a barcoded item to
	  more than one bibliographic record.  Use cases include: 1. Barcoded E-Readers with preloaded content     * Readers would all be items attached to a single "master" bib
	    record in the traditional way, through call numbers that define
	    their ownership * Each reader, as a barcoded item, can be attached through
	    Multi-homed Items to records describing the list of preloaded
	    content * These attached Multi-homed Items can be added and removed as
	  content is swapped out on each reader 2. Dual-language items     * Cataloger decides which of several alternate languages is the
	    primary, and attaches the barcoded item to that record in the
	    traditional way * Alternate language records are attached to this item through
	  Multi-homed Items 3. "Back-to-back" books -- two books printed upside down relative to
	    one another, with two "front" covers * Cataloger decides which of the two titles is the primary, and
	    attaches the barcoded item to that record in the traditional way * Alternate title record is attached to this item through
	  Multi-homed Items 4. Bound Volumes -- Sets of individual works collected into a single
	    barcoded package * Cataloger decides which of the titles is the primary (or creates a
	    record for the collection as a whole), and attaches the barcoded
	    item to that record in the traditional way * Remaining title records for the collected peices are attached to
	this item through Multi-homed Items Functionality funded by Natural Resources Canada --

	* Open-ILS/src/extras/import/marc2sre.pl.in: Enable marc2sre.pl to
	run reasonably fast with a large set of bibs Our previous iteration of marc2sre.pl used an ILIKE stanza beginning
	with a wildcard to match system control numbers without having to
	specify the institution's MARC code.  This worked, but was painfully
	slow in large bib sets as the database needed to use a bitmap index
	scan to find matches.  By adding a --prefix flag, the user can specify the institutional
	MARC code for the set of records and we can use an exact match
	against metabib.full_rec.value, which is immeasurably faster.  This
	is, of course, a problem if there are multiple institutional MARC
	codes in use for a given set of bibliographic records.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@20012

	* Open-ILS/src/extras/import/marc2sre.pl: Overhaul the marc2sre.pl
	script for importing MFHD records Add --bibfield / --bibsubfield options to support retrieving the bib
	record ID by searching the specified field/subfield for the
	identifier, instead of assuming that the identifier =
	biblio.record_entry.id. Avoiding the lookup will be much faster, but
	some sites want to start clean with their bibliographic record IDs,
	so this supports them.  Remove the need for passing in the owning user's password and simply
	do a lookup by username in the actor.usr table. This is a bit more
	secure as the password isn't exposed on the command line and you can
	easily set someone else as the owner of the records without having
	to know their password.  Add significant internal help via Pod::Usage.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19989

	update it piecemeal, which resulted in non-sensical dates that were
	forced to wrap.  For example, if the date object was to set to March
	31, 2011, and we tried .setMonth(3) on it to change it to April,
	that would result in an April 31st, which doesn't exist, and the

	   the ability to include some information associated with the call
	   number, such as classification scheme, prefix and suffix, in the

	   prefix and suffix reside in separate fields.  This prefix and
	   suffix should display in the OPAC as part of the call number and
	   should also be available for use in spine labels.   * Instant Detail for One Record Hit List - When searching for
	   records in the staff client, the ability to immediately land on the
	   bibliographic record instead of the search results screen when there
	   is only on matching search result in the system.  This enhancement

	* Open-ILS/examples/apache/eg.conf: Avoid Apache warnings resulting
	from duplicate NameVirtualHost directives Benjamin Shum reported that the Apache warnings that have been a
	part of Evergreen's default configuration on Apache start for ages
	could be avoided by commenting out the "NameVirtualHost: *80" line
	in eg.conf. Testing confirmed that the directive was not necessary

	* Open-ILS/src/extras/Makefile.install: Build libjs from source for
	now until the Perl threading problem can be reliably tested The previous commit changed JavaScript::SpiderMonkey to be built
	without thread safety, but on Fedora we had been installing the
	js-devel package (which was threaded). As you can't build a
	non-threaded JavaScript::SpiderMonkey on top of a threaded libjs,
	for now we'll make Fedora build a non-threaded libjs from source
	just like the other distros.  Note that the problem with threaded JavaScript::SpiderMonkey
	surfaced on Debian Lenny when targeting holds. Lenny has
	libthreads-perl 1.71, but a number of fixes have been committed to
	subsequent versions
	(http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/JDHEDDEN/threads-1.82/Changes) - so
	threading support might be reliable on more current distros. Once we
	have a reliable test, we might be able to go back to the packaged
	version of libjs.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19846

	well without one. As a result any checkin results in grace periods
	being negated.  The attached patch adds in-db grace periods for all non-booking
	transactions, removing the grace period from the fine generator cron
	job script and placing it on the circulation. Grace periods are set
	on the recurring fine rule with an override available on the circ
	matchpoint, identical to how renewal count can be overridden from
	the duration rule already. These grace periods are respected on
	checkin fine generation as well as on the fine generator cron job
	script.  The upgrade script will assume, by default, a grace period of 1, but
	has a \set line to change this. It will also update all circulations
	without a checkin by default, but another \set will allow disabling
	of that.  [ NOTE: for the history of the patch, see:

	for changing database settings. By creating the function in the

	inconsistent results when invoking LOWER() in C vs. UTF8 locale
	databases As reported by the Fundamental Science Library of Armenia, patron
	searches were not retrieving patrons who were known to be part of
	the patron database.  While the initial approach to solve this problem used an
	encode_utf8() call to encode the data before passing it on to the
	database, this turned out to break the patron search function in
	other environments.  Testing by Dan Wells confirmed that the LOWER() function returned
	different results when invoked against text in a database created
	with LC_CTYPE=C vs a database created with LC_CTYPE=*.UTF-8. As the
	patron search function used a Perl lc() function call to convert the
	incoming data to lowercase, the success of the call depended on the
	LC_CTYPE value of the database.  To avoid this problem in the future, we define our own
	evergreen.lowercase() function that can reliably produce lowercase
	text for characters outside the Latin1 range, and we convert our
	indexes and function calls to use that function consistently.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19715

	It shows everything "Required" does, but also shows fields flagged
	as "Suggested", stat cats, and surveys.  To control this and other things are the settings. They come in a
	few general categories, named ui.patron.edit.<fmclass>.<fmfield>.?
	where ? is one of the following: require - Flag the field as required when it otherwise wouldn't be.
	show - Show the field like required fields, but don't actually
	require it.  suggest - Show the field with required/shown fields in
	"show suggested fields" mode example - An example string for a field
	regex - A regular expression for validating a field Not all fields have all of the above options by default, although
	the initial list is the main limiter compared to the code side.  Also included are the following settings:
	ui.patron.edit.au.dob.calendar - If true, shows the calendar widget
	for the date of birth field ui.patron.edit.phone.example - Example
	for all phone fields without their own ui.patron.edit.phone.regex -
	Regex validator for all phone fields without their own
	ui.patron.edit.default_suggested - Default to showing suggested
	fields instead of all fields git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19663

	Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/WWW/SuperCat.pm: Add complete set
	of Evergreen search aliases and attributes to SRU explain Original "pull from database" code had limited the search aliases to
	those that were qualified; now we pull all of them, and if they are
	not qualified, we qualify them as "eg".  In addition, for some of the non-index attributes (sort, direction,
	site, available), restore the descriptive title that was previously
	available.  Slightly longer term we will add a "description" column
	to config.metabib_search_alias to store this information.  Also, we had always been using the global %qualifier_map in
	return_sru_explain(), even though the intention was to enable the
	authority explain index to pass in an overriding set of values. This
	commit breaks the authority SRU explain, but as it had been
	incorrectly dumping the bib explain, this brings us a step closer to
	proper explain support for authorities.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19572

	chpoint.tt2: Patch from Thomas Berezansky to implement circulation
	matchpoint value fallthrough, whereby specific rules can inherit
	values from generic rules.  Background, taken from
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/635463: Theory: Make the things returned (circulate, duration_rule,
	recurring_fine_rule, max_fine_rule, hard_due_date,
	total_copy_hold_ratio, available_copy_hold_ratio and renewals) "fall
	through" when set to NULL.  The circ matrix edit screen has had some changes too, partially for
	showing "Inherited" in some places where appropriate, partially for
	field ordering and editing display and consistency. The fields that
	show up earlier contribute to tests that will be applied to the
	circulation attempt, while the "results" that do not change what
	rows are considered are grouped at the end.  Pros: You can override a subset of those fields with a specific rule while
	allowing broader rules to fill in the holes.  This may result in
	less duplication of information across rules, making things easier
	to maintain.  Thus, this may result in less rules in general, and
	thus less processing time on sorting them overall.  Cons: Manually figuring out the specifics of what will happen will take
	more time/effort.  Changing a single rule may have a greater
	unintended effect on other rules.  Staff would need training for
	when to have a rule fall through and when to set it specifically.
	More time to return from the DB for any rule that is "falling
	through" to broader rules.  Examples for the following org tree: CONS -SYSA --LIBC --LIBD -SYSB --LIBE --LIBF Implementing the following "business" rules: At the CONS level: By default, everything circulates, uses DFLT_DUR
	duration, DFLT_RFINE recurring fine, and DFLT_MFINE max fine.  Circ
	Modifier "book" uses the duration BOOK_DUR Reference flagged
	materials don't circulate At the SYSA level there are no special rules.  At the SYSB level the max fine should be SYSB_MFINE.  At the LIBC level the recurring fine is LIBC_RFINE At the LIBD level circ modifier "book" uses the DFLT_DUR duration
	instead of "BOOK_DUR" At the LIBE level reference flagged materials circulate.  At the LIBF level there are no special rules.  The current method would require the following circ rules to
	implement those business rules: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC? DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE
	MAX_FINE CONS NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS
	NULL TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS book NULL TRUE

	DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBD book TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR
	DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBE NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE
	SYSB_MFINE LIBE book NULL TRUE BOOK_DUR DFLT_RFINE SYSB_MFINE 16 circ rules total.  The new method would require the following circ rules to implement
	those business rules: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC? DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE
	MAX_FINE CONS NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR DFLT_RFINE DFLT_MFINE CONS
	book NULL NULL BOOK_DUR NULL NULL CONS NULL TRUE FALSE NULL NULL
	NULL SYSB NULL NULL NULL NULL NULL SYSB_MFINE LIBC NULL NULL NULL
	NULL LIBC_RFINE NULL LIBD book NULL NULL DFLT_DUR NULL NULL LIBE
	NULL TRUE TRUE NULL NULL NULL 7 circ rules total.  Starting with the above, lets assume that SYSA wants to change their
	recurring fine to SYSA_RFINE.  LIBC's recurring fine is to be
	unchanged.  The current method requires the following changes: ADD the following entries: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC?
	DURATION_RULE RECURRING_FINE MAX_FINE SYSA NULL NULL TRUE DFLT_DUR
	SYSA_RFINE DFLT_MFINE SYSA NULL TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR SYSA_RFINE

	SYSA_RFINE DFLT_MFINE LIBD book TRUE FALSE DFLT_DUR SYSA_RFINE
	DFLT_MFINE 4 rules added, 2 changed, total is now 20 rules.  The new method would require the following changes: ADD the following entry: CIRC_LIB CIRC_MOD REFERENCE CIRC?

	* Open-ILS/src/perlmods/lib/OpenILS/Utils/MFHD/test/mfhd.t: Enable
	MFHD tests to find their testdata When the MFHD tests wrapped in mfhd.t are invoked from outside of
	the directory, they tests failed to find the mfhddata.txt file.
	Judicious use of the __FILE__ special literal and
	File::Basename::dirname() avoids that problem. Now we just need to
	munge @INC to ensure that testlib.pm can be resolved (and hope that
	no conflicts ever turn up).  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19442

	reporter.materialized_simple_record which required users to exactly
	match the form of the ISBN as entered in the MARC record to get a
	successful search result - pretty hit or miss.  The longer term fix in 2.0 and above is to make the ISBN search
	search against the identifier|isbn index, which also gets
	ISBN10/ISBN13 equivalence goodness.  But this patch will be
	relatively easy to backport through to 1.6.1 and plugs some of the
	holes in our exposed APIs and search points in the short term.  git-svn-id: svn://svn.open-ils.org/ILS/trunk@19432

	Open-ILS/web/templates/default/kcls-wire/results.tt2: started moving
	some inline styles into css classes Here's the deal so far: all the inline styles are covered by one
	class in semiauto.css, but those were created programatically and
	reflect no understanding of the relationship between the purpose of
	any given element that's styled and what its style is.  These
	auto-generated styles also are kind of redundant, since with many of
	them, instead of using the style with a long definition, you could
	use a combination of smaller styles.  The existing markup uses many slightly different style attributes,
	so there's plenty of stuff like "width: 12", "width: 13", "width:
	14", etc, so there's no way to map a lot of this to semantically
	meaningful names.  some of these classes are just going to end up
	with names like "wide-fourteen" that are no better than inline
	styles.  But others, as we find them manually, can be grouped and renamed
	into something meaningful, and sometimes style can be put into
	prexisting id and class definitions. Should be a couple more hours
	work.  semiauto.css reflects progress with the generated classes.  changes to style.css reflect early places where style could be moved
	into pre-existing classes.

	2, Open-ILS/web/templates/default/kcls-wire/record.tt2: JS stubbed
	out, mostly. See longer commit msg.  Here's the deal with JS so far.  A few instances of onfocus, onblur, onmouseout, and onmouseover have
	been left alone, as they're doing simple cosmetic things.  A lot of instances of onclick remain, and a couple onchange, but
	these now either a) just do cosmetic things (hide/unhide) or b) call
	stubbed out functions prepared in misc.js That doesn't mean we won't still totally rip out lots of this JS,
	but it leaves us a hint as to what is supposed to happen where.  I
	can easily see us losing track of that later.  So anyway, many of
	the stubbed functions will probably be replaced with purely server
	side functionality later, but until then, they can serve as a kind
	of documentation.
