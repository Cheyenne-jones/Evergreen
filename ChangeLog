    Tweak 0877 upgrade file for 2.5
    
    The 0877 upgrade file for 2.6 lacked in parsimony because it assumed
    it would generally run as part of the 2.6.0 upgrade, and that required
    a full reingest anyway.
    
    Credit for this "quick" version goes to Mike Rylander.

    LP#1259665 Split series browse config from search
    
    When we added browse support in 2.5, we took extra care to ensure that
    our series browse entries would sort and display reliably.
    
    800t does not specify non-filing characters, so it was excluded from
    browse.  Unfortunately, since browse and search had a single root
    config, this removed 800t from search as well.
    
    While we may want to reconsider expanding later on, this commit takes
    a conservative approach, and uses all series values for search and
    facets, but only entries with a usable filing indicator will be
    extracted for browse.  It accomplishes this by splitting the series
    config in two, one config for search/faceting, and a second config
    dedicated to browse (similar to what was done for title).

    Without this, a method error (such as when saving a patron fails at

    remove XUL @persist from list column definitions
    
    We moved away from @persist a long time ago, but some cruft remained.  This
    would cause a local file, localstore.rdf, to balloon in size as columns were
    adjusted in XUL-based lists.  Since this is an XML file, writing and parsing
    it can get very expensive if the file grows too large, which it has done for
    some people.
    
    This change keeps that file from growing further based on these list columns,
    but it may be worth deleting the localstore.rdf file or creating a new staff
    client profile (uninstalling and reinstalling the staff client DOES NOT
    accomplish this).

    Docs: Revive/merge content into "Using the Staff Client"
    
    This commit brings in three old sections and merges with any similar
    content.
    
    - Revive old section about sticky check box settings
    - Merge old section about Font and Sound settings
    
      Adds a brief section about zooming in the OPAC, and otherwise only
      reformats some lines to make them git-friendly.
    
    - Docs: Fix and copy Customize Toolbars section
    
      The old "Customizable Toolbar" docs section is already revived in the
      Evergreen Book "System Configuration and Customization" chapter. Since
      this feature seems to belong under "Using the Staff Client ->
      Workstation Administration", this commit duplicates it into that
      chapter. This also fixes a few asciidoc bugs in both places. And it
      fixes one bug in root.txt which caused "phonelist.txt" to be mentioned
      at the bottom of this section, but not actually included in the docs
      structure.
    
      In addition, the section "Button Bar/Toolbar" that was also under
      "Workstation Administration" has been moved up a level, since it
      pertains more to staff client users rather than admins. And the
      admin-specific content at the end of that section has been replaced
      with a link to the newly duplicated "Customizable Toolbar" section.
    
      The result of this reorganization should be:
    
      - Using the Staff Client
        - Button Bar/Toolbar (for staff client users)
        - Workstation Administration
          - Customizable Toolbar (for staff client admins)

    LP1198983: Remove deprecated useragent.override variable
    
    To quote Dan Wells in bug comment #6:
    
    Back in the 2.2 days, Evergreen had code which set the
    'general.useragent.override' to something like 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U;
    Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.25) Gecko/20111212 oils_xulrunner
    /xul/rel_2_2_0/server/'. For anyone who once had a 2.2 client installed
    and upgraded from it, this setting persists (this is the situation for
    most stations in our library).
    
    Since this string does not match the new test for 'open_ils_staff_client'
    in the useragent, these clients are not properly streaming requests. This
    problem was most easily noticed in Vandelay progress bars (they always
    jumped from 0% to 100%).
    
    This commit adds the code provided by Bill Erickson in the LP bug
    comments. To test it, you can add the 'general.useragent.override'
    setting to your staff client with any value (using the 'about:config'
    interface), then run this code and check that your setting is gone.

    LP1272316 - Calculate proximity in the DB for speed
    
    We need to calculate and store a (potenially adjusted) proxmity for
    each hold and copy for use in targetting and optimization of op
    capture.  Before this commit, we do that within the hold target
    code itself.  Now we'll do it when the hold-copy map is inserted,
    because we have the same information available at that time as we
    have in the targeter.  This will both speed up the apparent cost of
    the calculation, because it avoids the cost of a network round-trip,
    and the total number of SELECTs we must issue, because the proximity
    value will now be cached for use by the proximity map function.
    
    Backward compatability is retained for the create_prox_map() function
    in case any other code is depending on that.
