    LP#1334693 make_release optional -j <osrf_js_path>
    
    make_release supports a "-j" option for passing in the OpenSRF JS path:
    
    make_release [options] -j /openils/lib/javascript
    
    This is useful when running make_release, specifically the staff client
    building portion, on a machine where the OpenSRF libs are available
    (say, from a git checkout) but osrf_config is not available because
    OpenSRF is not actually installed.
    
    The script will attempt to find osrf_config and the JS path
    automatically, so under normal circumstances, -j is not required.

    LP#1339118: Ignore permission checks for "jump" context
    
    We don't worry about checking permissions on foreign objects when we're
    simply using them to get a context OU for the local object permission
    testing.  The "jump" field just gives us more layers of indirection, and
    shouldn't cause a perm check, just like normal foreign context OUs.

    LP#1234845: Performance improvement to evergreen.ranked_volumes() database function.
    
    For the client I analyzed logs from production Pg instance for ~ 10
    days.
    
    During this time, the single most time consuming query (summarized time
    for all instances of the query, with different parameters) was:
    
    SELECT * FROM unapi.bre ( ... ) AS "unapi.bre";
    
    I profiled this function, and found that in my test case most of the
    time (2.04s out of 2.06s, so ~ 99%) was spent in call to
    unapi.holdings_xml() function.
    
    When I profiled this function, I found that most of the time (sorry,
    don't have the number now with me) was spent in call to
    evergreen.ranked_volumes() function.
    
    At this moment in my research something changed on the server I was
    testing on, and all subsequent times were ~ 4-5 times lower, but the
    ratios were more or less the same.
    
    Anyway - call to evergreen.ranked_volumes() showed repeatable time (with
    full caches/buffers) of ~ 380ms.
    
    I modified the function by:
    1. inlining actor.org_unit_descendants(?, ?)
    2. inlining evergreen.rank_ou(?, ?, ?)
    3. extracting depth calculation to separate call
    4. switched to plpgsql (which gives me ability to use variables)
    5. removed evergreen.rank_ou() and evergreen.rank_cp_status() from
       select clause - these are still in WINDOW definition, but they
       weren't used in the SELECT, so it's better to remove from there.
    6. in passing renamed arguments to avoid name clash (argument depth vs.
       field depth)
    7. in passing changed usage of $* to access parameters to using named
       parameters, for readability.
    
    New function did the same work in ~ 18ms.

    LP#1254918 limit ACQ batch update fund retrieval by perms
    
    In the ACQ batch update bar along the top of the PO page, limit the
    number of funds which require permission checks on the server by
    limiting the fund search to those at org units where the requesting user
    has the CREATE_PURCHSE_ORDER or MANAGE_FUND permissions.
    
    In other words, if a user only has create-po perms at Branch 1, we can
    specifically request funds at that branch (or below) for display so that
    the server (PCRUD) does not have to inspect unrelated funds for
    permissibility.  This speeds up fund retrieval.

    LP#1254918: Allow skiping of user-object perms
    
    Previous to this commit, permissions in Evergreen check a cominbation
    of:
     * user-object permissions (does the user have a direct permission
       mapping to the object in question)
     * user-context permissions (does the user have the permission at the
       object's context location, whose field is defined in the IDL)
     * user-global permission (lacking a context location, does the user
       have the permission globally (at the top of the org tree) and therefore
       can apply the action to all objects of this typ)
    
    In practice, there are almost no user-object permissions.  When retrieving
    just on object from the database, the cost of this check is negligable to
    the point that we can completely ignore it.  However, when retrieving a
    large set of objects, such as the list of all funds in a large, consortial
    environment, the cost to check the user-object permission adds up to a
    noticable amount of time.
    
    To address this, we add a new construct to the IDL instructing the PCRUD
    infrastructure to skip user-object permission checking in those cases where
    the design and use of the system makes user-specific object permissions
    needless or superfluous.  This is embodied in a new XML attribute on the
    <pcrud> element: ignore_object_perms.  When set to "true", pcrud will skip
    all user-object permission checks, resulting in faster time-to-first-result.
    
    Additionally, we add a new "owning_user" attribute on the <action> element
    of the <pcrud> section. This new attribute specifies the field containing
    the actor.usr.id of the user that "owns" the object.  This allows PCRUD to
    test ownership of an object directly, and if the requesting user and owning
    user are the same, the action is allowed.
    
    Finaly, when "global_required" is "true" for the permission check, and there
    is no "owning_user" attribute defined for the class in the IDL, we skip the
    above-mentioned user-object permission check.  When "global_required" is
    "false" or there is an "owning_user" attribute, we check for user permissions.
    
    In all cases, the "ignore_object_perms" attribute is honored, and in its
    presence we skip non-owner user-object permissions.
    
    The net result is an immediate increase in speed for retrieval of objects
    in the presence of the "global_required" attribute, and a mechanism to
    increase the speed of specific cases of context-aware retrival by the use
    of "ignore_object_perms".
    
    We use this new mechanism to speed the retrieval of fund objects in the
    ACQ interfaces that draw available-fund dropdowns.

    LP#1308239 Support pre-cat copy hold targeting
    
    Remove an unused line of code in the hold targeter which was preventing
    targeting of pre-cat copies.
    
    In OpenILS::Utils::PermitHold::permit_copy_hold, neither in-db nor
    script based hold viability checks inspect the value of the
    "title_descriptor" field in the provided params.  Remove this field and
    pre-cats just work.

    LP#1210161: Finish renaming bookbag to list
    
    The JSPAC bookbag feature was renamed to "Lists" in TPAC, but several
    references still exist to "bookbag", "book bag", "Book Bag", etc. in the
    public and staff interfaces. This commit attempts to provide simple and
    clear replacements for the old term. In some cases "list" seems best,
    but where the context is uncertain "book list" is used to err on the
    side of clarity. Some of these changes may be in old code that is no
    longer used.
    
    This commit also includes two minor wording changes - one to fix grammar,
    and the second to update instructions for sharing a list.

    This commit revives the following sections from the 2.1 version of the docs
    and updates them for 2.6:
    
      - marc_export: Exporting Bibliographic Records into MARC files
        - includes new options for 2.6
      - Importing Authority Records from Command Line
      - Importing Authority Records from the Staff Client
    
    The first two are included in a new section called "Support Scripts"
    within the "Developer Resources" section, with a new intro and summary
    of other commonly used scripts provided with Evergreen. The third section
    is moved inside the Cataloging chapter "Batch Importing MARC Records",
    with slight modifications to the intro to that chapter.

    LP#1326149 Use a TPAC-settable TIME_FORMAT for local time formats
    
    We had tried to use the format.time library setting, but that is meant
    for Dojo which uses the Unicode formats, that are incompatible with
    the POSIX strftime() formats required by Template::Plugin::Date.
    
    At the same time, we need to expose the raw machine-readable time
    for schema.org consumers, so express that in a @content attribute.
    
    And we might as well use a more meaningful <time> element instead of
    the meaningless <span>, just for good measure.

    Instead of using titles / aria-labels directly on advanced search
    selectors, provide selector IDs so the existing text labels can be
    turned into <labels> and linked (by id) to their form control.
    
    This means we only need one label per form control, which improves

    Previous to this commit, once we have determined that there are no
    local Located URIs or foreign copies, we include the record in the
    result set in the staff client.  However, the desire of library staff
    is that foreign Located URIs be valid as a visibility limiter.  So
    we now recheck at the end for that situation.  This honors the new
    "Located URIs act like copies" global flag.

    This patch adjusts the example A/T filter for the
    hold_request.shelf_expires_soon hook to exclude hold requests that are
    already marked as fulfilled.  This saves time creating events that
    would immediately be marked as invalid per the HoldIsAvailable
    validator.
    
    It also addresses an issue for large databases that have lots of
    fulfilled holds wherein hold_request.shelf_expires_soon events can
    fail to be added at all due to a cstore timeout.

    LP#1296937: move the $force_bc parameter of ->charged_items() to an implementation method
    
    Argubably, the $force_bc parameter of OpenILS::SIP::Patron->charged_items()
    method exists solely as an implementation convenience for the renew-all
    code.  Consequently, this patch removes the $force_bc parameter from the
    public interface for charged_items() and spins it off into a new
    implementation method.
    
    This patch should be applied at the same time that a reversion of
    SIPServer commit c97d64412bc is applied.  Note that a user who upgrades
    SIPServer without upgrading Evergreen to a version that contains this
    patch will end up in a situation where the code that counts active
    loans for the patron information response will fetch the loans using
    $force_bc set to true; this works only by coincidence.

    LP#1321017: Order constituent records by quality
    
    Previously, in some cases (often needlessly) we ordered constituent
    records within a metarecord by a combination of type/form/blvl.  This
    is not only of little use, but also expensive.  Instead, order them
    by the bib's calculated quality, which takes type/form/blvl into account
    already.
    
    Also, use the new metabib.record_sorter to find the title tie-breaker
    instead of using the view-of-a-view-of-a-view mrd compatability shim.
    
    The net result is several orders of magnitude speed increase for
    constituent record retrieval.  In particular, this resolves a problem
    where doing a SIP2 patron information lookup and requesting a list
    of holds could cause a timeout if the patron has one or more
    metarecord holds.
    
    This patch also causes the format filter parameter of the following
    methods to be ignored:
    
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord_to_records*
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord.mods_slim.batch.retrieve*
    open-ils.search.biblio.metarecord.mods_slim.retrieve*
    
    Since the only use of the format filter was in JSPac code, and since
    the record attributes mechanism has changed considerably, this removal
    should be considered intentional.
    
    Note that this patch includes a squash of a minor follow-up by Galen
    Charlton to remove variables made unused by the original patch.

    In order to make sure that the transparent boolean pushdown does
    not cause filters and modifiers to end up deeply embedded in the
    query tree, we put them at the front.
    
    This is a short-term fix.  Long-term, we need to make use of the
    floating subquery syntax ( {{ ... }} ) available in QueryParser,
    which is designed to address the semantic separation between what
    the user types into the search box, and the various UI widgets that
    can add query clauses.

    Remove buggy, unused function get_leaders_from_usergroup
    
    Recent editing and testing of get_leaders_from_usergroup() uncovered an
    unrelated bug which renders the function useless (it returns all group
    members, not just the leader). It wasn't previously caught because
    Evergreen has no apparent references to this function. This commit
    removes the unused function.

    LP#1321429: Use server-local time as best-guess
    
    When first calculating the shelf expire time, we assume "now" as
    the starting point by calling DateTime->now().  However, that gives
    us the time in UTC.  That's not good because closed dates are stored
    timezone-aware.  Instead, ask for server-local time.

    Commit fc99f4f2 made an incomplete style change, changing
    'results_header_bar' to be a class, but not changing the CSS.  The
    simplest solution is to restore 'results_header_bar' to be an id, as
    this fixes the main view, the responsive view, and also any custom CSS
    which might affect this id.

    The function "authority.calculate_authority_linking" was not able to deal with
    situations where there are multiple marc tags that are linkable. The function
    only process the first tag that contains a linking_subfield and returns that
    to be inserted into the authority_linking table, even when there are more than
    one of the same tag with linking_subfield.
    
    Added an additional loop to loop through each tag, for situations where there are
    multiples of each tag.

    There was a logic inversion that was causing miss-use of a per-

    in practice.
    
    Also, after finding one use of a linked field we moved on to the
    next, though it is possible for more than one link to exist for
    different uses of a name, say.  Now we'll loop through all fields
    to find all possible linkages.
