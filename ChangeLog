    LP#1361266 Patron self-registration form accepts date of birth in wrong format
    
    This patch applys some basic javascript to validate that a date entered is
    at least in ISO 8601 format.  This prevents someone from entering "cupcake"
    or 55/66/6666 as a valid date of birth by validating the stgu.dob input
    at the time of submission.

    LP#1465847 Empty patron search exits early
    
    If no search parameters or invalid search parameters are sent to the
    patron search API, the API call exits early with zero results.  This
    avoids cases where empty searches can lead to heavy DB calls, querying
    and sorting he entire patron data set.

    LP#1491962 Fix 0847 Live Test
    
    The fix for LP 1484281 broke the 0847.auth_overlay_generator.pg live
    test.  Since e was removed from the controlled subfield list for the
    100 authority tag, it needs to be removed from the expected live test
    results.
    
    This commit does that.

    LP# 1484281 auth control config update to prevent propagated data deletion
    
    Remove subfield 'e' from authority.control_set_authority_field seed values
    
    Removed from the auth tag 100 and 110, which should apply to bib tags
    100,110,600,610,700,710
    
    Added upgrade script, and pgTAP test.
    
    How to test this patch
    ----------------------
    [1] To test this bug you need 1 authority record and at least 1 bib record.
    The auth record needs to have an auth 100 or 110 tag that has a subfield $e,
    for example 100 $aDavis, Miles $ecomposer. (for the record, it is not good
    cataloging practice to have $e in the auth record, but it can happen by mistake.)
    The bib record needs to be have a matching bib 100 or 700 tag with the same
    subfield $a and $e. In addition the matching bib tag has to be linked to the
    authority record, i.e. the bib tag has to have a bib subfield $0 with the DB
    id of the authority record.
    
    [2] If you open up the authority record, in the authority MARC editor, and remove
    the subfield $e; the subfield $e found in the bib record tag will be removed.
    This is a mistake because normally bib record tags 100/110/700/710 do use subfield
    $e, though the subfield $e should not be used in the auth record 100/110 tags.
    
    [3] When this patch is applied, if a cataloger removes a subfield $e from an auth
    100/110 tag, the deletion will not cascade to its linked bibs.
