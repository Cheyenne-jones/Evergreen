    LP#1424755: Org Unit Setting view permissions can be bypassed
    
    Fix private org. unit setting leakage by forcing the $auth argument
    to true if not passed in when open-ils.actor.ou_setting.ancestor_default
    or open-ils.actor.ou_setting.ancestor_default.batch are called.
    
    Other than a change to the desc of the public methods to reflect that
    they now check permissions if permissions are required, there are no
    required api changes to the back or the front ends.

    LP#1206589: Temporary Fix for Org. Unit Settings History Bug
    
    This commit makes two changes to the coustl IDL entry.
    
    1. It adds a retrieve permission of STAFF_LOGIN.  This at least
    requires someone with staff permission to be able to view settings
    history.
    
    2. It fixed the primary key field from date_applied to id.  The
    prior setting was just an outright error.
    
    NOTE: This is intended as a short term fix for the Library Settings
    Editor history feature.

    LP #1406350 Mobile Device Navigation Issue Fix for Shelf Browser
    
    Currently, when a browser window is narrowed too much, whether
    in a mobile browser, or on a desktop or laptop machine, the
    "Previous Page" and "Next Page" navigation links disappear. The
    only solution that seems to solve this is by removing the
    "THEAD" element from the shelf browser table.
    
    This patch removes that tag, adds a new row to imitate a new
    border as existed before, and modifies the CSS in .../opac/
    css/style.css.tt2 to address that difference.

    it should only use controlled subfields.

    LP#1155313: Repair generation of label_sortkey for monograph_part entries
    
    The evergreen.lpad_number_substrings function attempts to codify numeric
    fields within labels.  It does this by finding the strings, padding them
    to a given size, and replacing them in the source string.  For instance:
           3 => 0000000003
        15.4 => 00000000150000000004
    
    The algorithm was fooled by repeated characters, like in 15.1:
        15.1 => 00000000000000000150000000001  INCORRECT
    
    This change will result in the correct value.

    LP#1425191 Restore summarization of serial units
    
    In a previous commit, code was added for force summaries to be limited
    to a certain type (to prevent cross type contamination of summaries).
    This had the negative side-effect of preventing summaries on units, as
    the units were not requesting a 'type' for their summary.
    
    While we could force the unit code to send a type, it seemed generally
    more flexible to restore the removed support for returning all summary
    information in the absense of a requested type.  This could lead to
    cross-type summaries for units, but that is a larger issue altogether
    (i.e. how we can properly support cross-type units at all).

    provided to allow the user to return to a title hold. If the hold starts as a
    metarecord hold, this link won't display since we don't know which bib the
    patron wants.
    
    Also fixes an issue where the hold cancel button always returned the user to

    LP#957466 Vandelay set the 905$u to current user if not defined
    
    This version only adds a 905$u if none already exist in the document. It
    does so by creating a new 905 tag with subfield u. It does not add on
    to any possibly existing 905 tag that does not have a subfield u.
    
    This will cause the code in the previous commit to trigger and update the
    appropriate fields in biblio.record_entry.

    LP#957466: Update editor/edit_date/source on overlay
    
    This commit does three things.
    
    1. It removes some declared variables that are never used in this
    function.
    
    2. It updates the bib record edit_date field (along with the editor) if
    an editor is found in the MARC. If an editor is not found (or doesn't
    match an Evergreen user), it seems best to leave the edit_date
    unchanged so as not to imply that the previous editor is responsible for
    the newest edit.
    
    3. If a bib source is chosen in the vandelay importer UI, it updates the
    bib record with the source. To access this field, the reference to table
    "queued_record" is replaced by its child table "queued_bib_record".
    Since the new table is a child of the other, all of the other needed
    values are still available.

    LP#1154579: explicitly alert if copy location failed to be deleted
    
    This patch adds an alert if the act of deleting a copy
    location in the staff interface fails -- which would
    most commonly happen if there are still active items
    attached to the location to be deleted.

    LP#904581: when calculating hold status, be more careful about fetching transits
    
    This patch fixes a problem where if a hold meets the following
    criteria, an "Invalid date format: at /usr/share/perl5/Error.pm"
    error can be thrown when fetching its details:
    
    - the hold has a captured item
    - the captured item has status 8 (on hold shelf)
    - there is another item that is currently in transit to fill the hold
    - the pickup library (or one of its ancestors) has the
      circ.hold_shelf_status_delay library setting set.

    LP#1418772: Avoid internal server error on viewing full record when copy create_date is null
    
    In the TPAC client, when it tries to show record details containing a copy
    record with no create date, it shows an Internal Server Error instead.
    
    1. The error is caused by trying to execute the parse_datetime() method
    in the parse_date() function in the WWW/EGCatLoader/util.pm module with
    an empty date string. The function will normally translate a datetime
    string from the database to a datetime string that is formatted for TPAC
    templates.  The fix is to not execute parse_datetime() and just return
    an empty string.
    
    2. In the record/copy_table.tt2 template, if an empty datetime string is
    the value for copy_info.create_date, the format() method of the Date
    plugin will show the current datetime by default. The fix is to show '-'
    in its place, replicating the same template logic as for
    copy_info.due_date.

    LP#1419813 Fix default joins for config.rule_age_hold_protection.
    
    config.rule_age_hold_protection had a "has_a" relationship
    to several copy and copy-like sources when age protection
    is optional.  Changing those to "might_have" to allow left
    joins by default.
