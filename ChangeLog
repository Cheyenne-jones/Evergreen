	* fix regression with org selector when specifying ?ol= and the org
	  unit hiding setting is unset

	* some interfaces (or at least org_unit_settings.js) was not
	  infering the identifier value here. This helps the filtering org
	  select dijit in that interface

	* Build and flatten a tree, correcting a sorting issue in some OU
	  dropdowns.
	  
	  The previous code assumed that work org units would be delivered
	  in hierarchical order, but alas, they are not. Thus, we build the
	  hierarchy and then flatten it, sorting at each level.
	  This will be non-fast with many work OUs, but the common case is
	  a small set, which is not painful.
	  
	  Further improvement is warranted when the above proves false.

	* improve performance of multi-class searches
	  
	  Backport of trunk commit 18233.
	  
	  For as yet unknown reasons, Postgres sometimes uses
	  nested loops instead of hash joins when joining subqueries
	  in a multi-class bib search. This can result in searches
	  such as "author:rowling title:harry potter" never completing.
	  
	  Removing the interior limit clause can both speed up the query
	  and make search results more accurate when combining queries
	  of two or more common words.
