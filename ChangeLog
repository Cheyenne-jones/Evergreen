    Add pgTAP test for normalized MARC records
    
    Specifically, we're concerned about ensuring that any changes related to
    the fix for Encode (requiring the removal of the effectively useless but
    now erroring decode_utf8()) do not inadvertently change the content of
    the MARC records on ingest. Because we wouldn't want to have to reingest
    everything to normalize search, etc.

    Encode.pm change to the UTF8 flag
    
    In the past, decode_utf8() silently ignored attempts to decode data
    with the UTF8 flag on. However, Encode.pm changed around 2.53 and
    resulted in wide-character errors preventing the likes of
    --load-all-sample from working.
    
    Since our data should already be UTF8 when it hits these functions, we
    should not be trying to decode it in the first place.

    LP1125471 - Use label instead of id in recording in-house use prompt
    
    When recording multiple in-house use with the library settings for threshold
    prompts, the prompt would bring up the ID as the variable instead of the name
    of the non-cataloged material. This caused confusion among staff members who
    might see a message like: "Are you sure you want to mark 9 as having been used
    21 times?" (9 being the id, not the name of the non-cataloged material)
    
    This commit leverages existing code which had been commented out and under
    the ID to use the label name for the non-cataloged material instead. Also,
    minor bugfix with a missing semi-colon at the end of the function being used.

    Prevent odd TPAC base URL redirect
    
    As it stands, in a default install, if you browse to
    
    http://yourserver.com/eg/opac
    
    you are redirected to a login page, and if you login, you then get
    to the 404 page. This behavior is caused by the fact that *any*
    URLs which do not match a few select cases are assumed to be
    "secure" resources, when in fact they might not even exist.
    
    This commit catches any attempt to browse this 'base' and simply
    redirects to the "home" page instead.
    
    This addresses the most obvious and likely 404 of this type, but
    we might consider catching some other cases (e.g. eg/opac/record/).
    In addition (or as an alternative), we could also create a function
    call which simply checks the validity of a URL before we ask the
    user to login to see it.

    Use copy owning library as the context for finding best hold sort order setting
    
    In the olden days before best hold sort order and proximity adjustment, there was
    no need to consider any context org other than "here", because the choices were,
    essentially, FIFO or Traditional applied within the hard-boundary range.  However,
    now we need to decided whose rule to follow, and the most correct arbiter of that
    is the owning library of the call number of the copy.  We avoid copy circ lib
    because that can change with floating copies.

    Skip duplicate username check when username unchanged
    
    Changing a username, then changing back to the user's current
    username results in a duplicate username detection -- a false
    positive due to the API call finding a user with that username --
    the current user. This prevents you from saving any other changes
    you may have made to the user.
    
    This can be prevented by skipping the duplicate username check if
    the user is not new and the username in the field matches the
    username stored in the in-memory Javascript representation of the
    user.
    
    There's still a potential corner case which could be avoided by
    using a new/modified API call to either accept an "except this
    au.id" argument or to return the au.id of the found user, but I
    don't see a need for that at this point.

    LP#842991 Reports needs to error when deleting fails
    
    When attempting to delete a report template, the reports interface
    incorrectly shows "Action Succeeded" even when it partly fails. If the
    user performing the delete does not own all the dependent reports and
    outputs, then the perl function returns 1 to indicate that some were
    deleted, but not all. However, the javascript that calls that function
    does not check for a return value of 1. This commit adds that check, and
    also improves the formatting of the related error messages.

    TPAC: Use indexed subfields only in author search links
    
    Addresses LP# 1267231 in which we found that the titles of works in the added
    author field (such as subfield t) were showing up in the link ahead of the
    author's birth and death date (if applicable). Now we reserve the link for
    only the indexed author subfields (depends on whether the name is personal,
    corporate, or conference, but generally subfields a/b/c/d/e/n/q), then the
    extra subfields go after the name + dates, then we finally put the relationship
    into the parentheses after everything else.
    
    We also simplify the markup so that each name is contained in a single <span
    class="rdetail_author_div"> element to make it easier to control the layout.

    Serials: Batch Receive interface Copy Location widget was inert
    
    Choosing a value from the Copy Location widget wasn't working.  You'd
    get a default copy location (or the one supplied by the Receive Unit
    Copy Template) no matter what you set that control too.
    
    This is fixed.  One does not read from XUL menulist element by using its
    'value' property.

    Create 008 - take only the first field/subfield combo
    
    In the event that there were multiple $a subfields in, say, 044, the create 008
    function could spew raw XML into the 008 field. Avoid that by taking the primary
    instance.

    LP#1235474: fix failure of authority browse context menu to render
    
    This patch fixes a situation where if an authority record that would
    be brought up by the authority browse context menu in the MARC editor
    lacks an 003 field, the context menu would not be rendered all, meaning
    that the default context menu (e.g., cut/copy/paste/etc.) would be
    displayed instead.

    Although Net::HTTPS:Any wants Net:SSLeay 1.30 or later, 1.55 is apparently too
    late, or something. The alternative is Crypt::SSLeay, which seems to work, so
    let's go with that.
