	* Make autoconf 2.6.1 an explicit requirement due to
	  AC_PROG_MKDIR_P macro usage
	  
	  RHEL 5.4 still ships with autoconf 2.59 (released in 2003, folks)
	  and fails
	  because MKDIR_P isn't defined. For now, let's kill it right at
	  the ./configure
	  step until we decide whether to use the marked-as-obsolete
	  AM_PROG_MKDIR_P
	  macro instead.

	* escape "s in hand-built JSON ... should probably build an object
	  and call js2json against it, but this gets the job done for now
