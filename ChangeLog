    Changes to smooth out make_release
    
    1) Make the fake 'HeadURL' into a URL which works with our web repo.
    Note that this has 'tags/' hardcoded in, so it only works with true
    release branches (e.g. rel_x_y_z) not "working" branches
    (e.g. rel_x_y).
    
    2) Change range selector when building log to better exclude commits
    from previous releases.

    LP#1419172 Optimize full_circ_count view to avoid seq scans
    
    As reported by Chris Sharp:
    
    "The reporter.classic_item_list view was modified in bug 1208572 to use
    extend_reporter.full_circ_count to provide the use count for each item.
    Unfortunately, this change was found to be the cause of consistently
    long-running (2+ hours) reports queries in PINES as its query plan on
    our PostgreSQL 9.3 server was resulting in sequential scans of both the
    circulation and aged_circulation tables."
    
    This commit restructures the view to avoid JOINs, and is in production
    at PINES with noted improvement.

    LP 1450561: Restore org. unit settings history limit function and trigger
    
    The evergreen.limit_oustl function and the limit_log_oustl trigger on
    config.org_unit_setting_type_log were missed in the upgrade scripts
    when these were added to the base schema.  This commit adds them and a
    pgtap test to check that they exist after.
    
    This commit also alters the body of the limit_oustl function to take into
    account of the org unit when deleting entries from the log table.  This
    change allows multiple consortium members to have their own five history
    entries.  The original code only kept the last five entries of any given
    setting across the whole installation.

    The current unAPI calls consider opac_visibility of the status,
    but not the copy itself. If you have a record with copies set to
    opac_visible = false, you might see few or no copies in the OPAC
    results list, as these invisible copies may be the first five
    returned, and they then crowd out the visible copies.

    LP#1478123: fix leak of file descriptors by Apache workers
    
    Apache backends handling TPAC requests and making requests
    of the added content handler were not properly closing

    to plug the leak.

    LP#1394989: Do not include deleted users when retrieving for Collections
    
    As a side effect of discovering that users with no cards were being retrieved
    as part of the Collections API calls, those users ended up being mostly
    made up of deleted users (merged with an actual lead record, etc.)
    
    This patch contribued by Bill Ott changes the retrieval so that it skips
    over those deleted users.

    LP#1394989: Make users_of_interest test for defined actor.usr.card values
    
    If the open-ils.collections.users_of_interest API encounters a patron that
    has a null "card" value in actor.usr the API will crash with an error like:
    
    Received Exception:
    Name: osrfMethodException

    This patches users_of_interest to provide "undef" in the event that there is
    not a proper barcode associated with the user when retrieving results for the
    API call.

    LP#1465385: Fix some syntax issues with make_release
    
    Some versions of bash become confused when a unary = operator
    is used in place of a binary == operator.  Also, some variables
    live without the protection of quoting, and thus further confuse
    the shell when their contents are not as simple as originally
    expected.
    
    Here we adress those issues.

    LP#1465830: authority linker now ignores $e and $4 in bib name headings
    
    presence of relator terms or codes in $e or $4 can prevent authority
    headings linking
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Create an authority record with a name heading like this
    
        100 $a Example, Natalia $d 1945-
    
    [2] Create a bib record that contains the name and a relator
        code or term, e.g.,
    
        100 $a Example, Natalia $d 1945- $4edt
    
    [3] Run authority_control_fields.pl. Note that the
        heading in the bib is *NOT* linked, as evidence
        by no $0 being added to the bib heading and no
        rows added to authority.bib_linking for that bib
        and authority.
    
    [4] Apply the patch and re-run step 3.  This time,
        the link gets established:
    
        100 $a Example, Natalia $d 1945- $4 edt $0 (CONS)xxx
