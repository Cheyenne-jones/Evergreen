    LP#1390225: Fail to care about errors from auth.session.delete
    
    We're just tossing this call over the wall and moving on.  We don't
    care if the session wasn't there to delete or even if we didn't pass
    a session to the server.

    lp1383763 - Display OpenURL embargo statement
    
    The ResolverResolver service fetches the embargo statement (such as
    "Last year not available") from OpenURL resolvers and stores it in a
    target_embargo field. In JSPAC we used to display this along with the
    coverage statement, because it is very important that people know that a
    resource may be available from 1999 but the last year isn't available
    online.
    
    Restore the display of this information to the TPAC.

    LP#1379824 Make PermaCrud.js disconnect() actually disconnect
    
    The disconnect() method in PermaCrud.js was meant to wrap the
    underlying session disconnect, but it never actually disconnected
    the session.  This could lead to problems in long-living PermaCrud
    objects, as they may think they are still connected when they are not
    (the session remote_id is never cleared).
    
    Also, remove a couple (now redundant) manual session.disconnect() calls.

    As described in the bug, the library setting "Self Check: Patron Login Timeout

    It looks like some of it was already being pulled in, like the variable, but
    the interface was not utilizing it.
    
    This commit borrows from the old JS selfcheck and implements a default of
    three minutes for selfcheck timeout otherwise handled by the library setting.

    The metabib.record_attr_flat view previously pulled its data

    maintenance overhead, it ends up being an optimization fence
    for certain data sets.  So, we pull the logic from the leaf
    views up into the main view.  And, poof, 2 orders of magnitude
    speedup on large data sets.

    LP#1254918 limit ACQ batch update fund retrieval by perms
    
    In the ACQ batch update bar along the top of the PO page, limit the
    number of funds which require permission checks on the server by
    limiting the fund search to those at org units where the requesting user
    has the CREATE_PURCHSE_ORDER or MANAGE_FUND permissions.
    
    In other words, if a user only has create-po perms at Branch 1, we can
    specifically request funds at that branch (or below) for display so that
    the server (PCRUD) does not have to inspect unrelated funds for
    permissibility.  This speeds up fund retrieval.

    LP#1254918: Allow skiping of user-object perms
    
    Previous to this commit, permissions in Evergreen check a cominbation
    of:
     * user-object permissions (does the user have a direct permission
       mapping to the object in question)
     * user-context permissions (does the user have the permission at the
       object's context location, whose field is defined in the IDL)
     * user-global permission (lacking a context location, does the user
       have the permission globally (at the top of the org tree) and therefore
       can apply the action to all objects of this typ)
    
    In practice, there are almost no user-object permissions.  When retrieving
    just on object from the database, the cost of this check is negligable to
    the point that we can completely ignore it.  However, when retrieving a
    large set of objects, such as the list of all funds in a large, consortial
    environment, the cost to check the user-object permission adds up to a
    noticable amount of time.
    
    To address this, we add a new construct to the IDL instructing the PCRUD
    infrastructure to skip user-object permission checking in those cases where
    the design and use of the system makes user-specific object permissions
    needless or superfluous.  This is embodied in a new XML attribute on the
    <pcrud> element: ignore_object_perms.  When set to "true", pcrud will skip
    all user-object permission checks, resulting in faster time-to-first-result.
    
    Additionally, we add a new "owning_user" attribute on the <action> element
    of the <pcrud> section. This new attribute specifies the field containing
    the actor.usr.id of the user that "owns" the object.  This allows PCRUD to
    test ownership of an object directly, and if the requesting user and owning
    user are the same, the action is allowed.
    
    Finaly, when "global_required" is "true" for the permission check, and there
    is no "owning_user" attribute defined for the class in the IDL, we skip the
    above-mentioned user-object permission check.  When "global_required" is
    "false" or there is an "owning_user" attribute, we check for user permissions.
    
    In all cases, the "ignore_object_perms" attribute is honored, and in its
    presence we skip non-owner user-object permissions.
    
    The net result is an immediate increase in speed for retrieval of objects
    in the presence of the "global_required" attribute, and a mechanism to
    increase the speed of specific cases of context-aware retrival by the use
    of "ignore_object_perms".
    
    We use this new mechanism to speed the retrieval of fund objects in the
    ACQ interfaces that draw available-fund dropdowns.

    Fix LP904860, Cannot print a patron address label
    
    The sequence of events for printing an address label is as follows.
    Staff client Code in the util/print.js file builds an HTML page of the
    address label.  The page includes two vital components, 1) a source tag
    to pull 'print_win.js' file from the server, and 2) an onload event
    handler bound to the body tag to execute a 'print_init()' function that
    is defined in the source tag.
    
    However, print_init() is undefined because the source tag contains a
    badly formed URL. It needs to be prefixed by 'oils://remote' so that the
    new 'oils:' protocol can be used to pull the file remotely from the
    server.

    LP#1361801: Add required fields to serial issuance form
    
    This commit prevents issuances from being created without a date_published
    or holding_code. This has two benefits:
    
      1. Prevents uncaught exceptions related to submitting null values for
         either of those fields.
      2. Requiring date_published prevents an ugly error when trying to
         predict new issuances from an issuance without a date_published.
    
    This commit does NOT provide any feedback to the user about which fields
    are required. That would require further investigation into the Dojo/Dijit
    objects being used for the edit form fields.

    LP#1246859: Improve username flow for staged users
    
    Staged users in most cases have a username that consists of a UUID.
    
    Rather than leave the UUID as their username or require staff to
    clear the field and replace it with a barcode or other value, it
    would be better to remove this username when loading the staged user
    in the user editor.
    
    This commit clears the username when loading a stage user if the
    username looks like a UUID.
    
    If a barcode has been staged for the loaded staged user, the
    username will be populated with that value.
    
    If there is no staged barcode, the username will remain blank and
    will be populated using the standard method after staff enters a
    value in the barcode field.

    LP#1358916: refuse to retrieve over-large MARC records via Z39.50
    
    At least one malformed record discovered in the wild can
    cause open-ils.search backends to balloon to over 3G of memory
    consumption.  This patch works around that by refusing
    to process any (MARC) Z39.50 results that are larger than the
    MARC record maximum of 99,999 octets.

    Docs: Fix filenames to match references in the docs - second time
    
    This is just like the fix that Remington Steed sent in on Sept 4th.
    
    These images were creating errors for me when I try to create
    an epub version of the docs because they are all referenced as .jpg
    but the filenames were .JPG.

    LP#1359934: prevent error opening patron search form
    
    As a result of the patch for OpenSRF bug 1316245, JSON2js
    in the OpenSRF library is now stricter -- in particular, passing
    an undefined value to it results in an exception being thrown.
    
    This patch runs with the increased strictness and fixes an
    issue where the patron search form was passing an undefined value
    to JSON2js.
