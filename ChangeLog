    LP#1694696 - Check for blank SMS Carriers in A/T reactor
    
    Currently, the get_sms_gateway_email subroutine does not check
    for the truthiness of sms_carrier, which can result in catastrophic
    failure for a running server.  This adds that check.

    LP#1686194 Account for adjustments when generating fines
    
    Fine generation stops at a predetermined 'max fines' amount, but this
    does not account for possible adjustments which lower the effective
    fine amount.  This situation is common in cases where lost items are
    returned, and the library wants to generate additional overdues upon
    that event.
    
    With this commit, fine generation will pull in any adjustments applied
    to overdue fines, and use those to offset the current total fine when
    checking for max fines.
    
    Also includes test for this condition.

    LP1690434: Date Comparisons in the Reporter
    
    Because of the way the where clause is constructed
    in queries using the Year + Month Transform reports
    using some types of operators could produce invalid
    SQL.
    
    To test:
    put together a simple report template with a date
    in the Basic Filters section, using the Year + Month
    transform and the On or After operator. (a count of
    circs with an xact_start filter is a simple way to
    set this up.) Schedule it with a relative date
    such as 1 month ago and run it.
    
    Pre Patch: the report will fail and the error text
    will reference a missing text >= double precision
    comparison function.
    
    Post Patch: you'll get a count of how many circs
    were opened last month (or whatever report you
    wrote).

    LP1312824 open-ils.circ.hold.change_title fix
    
    Add a capture_time => undef limit to both change_title
    APIs to prevent currently captured holds from being reset
    when moving holds from one title to another.
    More work is needed to prevent items currently in transit
    from having their transits canceled.
    
    Test plan
    ---------
    1. Create a bib with multiple holdings
    2. Add multiple holds to this title and capture one of them - Item
       will have a status of On Holds Shelf
    3. Open another bib record, open Actions for this Record menu,
       Mark as Hold Transfer Destination
    4. Return to the record that has a captured hold, open Actions for
       this Record, Transfer all Title Holds
    5. Check Captured hold, Item status is Available, hold has been reset
       and now points to the new bib record.
    
    With the patch applied, steps 2-5 above should be repeated, but this
    time in step 5 the hold will still be on the original record and the
    item's status will still be On Holds Shelf.

    Docs: Fix buggy AsciiDoc rendering of backticks
    
    Apparently, AsciiDoc matches backticks (`) with single quotes (') as a
    valid quote pair, and this happens before matching a pair of backticks.
    So in cases where a pair of backticks is followed by only one single
    quote (not within a word), the first backtick is treated as a single
    quote, thus breaking the backtick pair and not applying the intended
    monospace formatting.
    
    This commit fixes two such cases by escaping the backticks. This doesn't
    prevent the same problem in the future, but I haven't found any way to
    change this parsing behavior.
