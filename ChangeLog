	* Backport just the bib-source setting portion of r17403
	  
	  When importing a set of records from Vandelay, the bib source
	  selection widget
	  on the Vandelay screen should actually affect the
	  biblio.record_entry.source
	  value of the imported records.

	* Update version stamp for Evergreen service, adopting branch
	  convention from trunk
	  
	  http://hostname/gateway?service=open-ils.actor&method=opensrf.open-ils.system.ils_version
	  was returning "1-5" for a number of systems we checked; in trunk,
	  we have adopted the
	  "x-y" convention for branches, so in the 1.6 branches we will
	  follow the "x-y-z"
	  approach for a little more clarity.

	* Forward-port of a patch from Steve Callendar, via James Fournie,
	  via launchpad:
	  
	  When the patron.password.use_phone is set, new patrons are
	  created with their password set to the last 4 digits of their
	  phone number, HOWEVER, when a patron's password is reset, it does
	  not work properly. Although the little underlined summary shows
	  the proper 4 digits, the password box displays 9-ish digits, and
	  is not the last 4 digits of the password.
	  
	  The attached patch was created by Steve Callender and is
	  confirmed working on 1.6.0
	  
	  This patch will not work on 2.0 as that has a new user editor,
	  but it would presumably be worthwhile to verify this
	  functionality works in that editor as well.

	* prevent repeat renderings of opac sidebar (relevant subjects,
	  authors, etc.) in Firefox. What's happening is that the
	  rresultHandleMods is not firing immediately with each record
	  retrieve, and so we get a flurry at the end where
	  resultPageIsDone() returns true for all of them, triggering the
	  allRecordsReceived event more than once. So now at the end of the
	  first allRecordsReceived event chain, we set a global variable,
	  and have these render functions check to see if it has been set.

	* Avoid scary SSL / HTTPS errors in Apache configuration
	  
	  When port 443 is the last listener port, Apache generates lots
	  of "unknown protocol speaking not SSL to HTTPS port!?" errors in
	  the logs - which are scary, but harmless. Putting port 80 last
	  avoids those errors entirely, per

	* Prevent ingest errors when asset.uri ID value outstrips
	  asset.call_number
	  
	  We were basing IDs in asset.uri on the max ID of
	  asset.call_number,
	  which occasionally led to major ingest problems as attempts to
	  insert
	  the next ID into asset.uri failed because that ID already
	  existed. Using
	  the max ID from asset.uri for asset.uri inserts seems to make
	  more sense
	  and does resolve that problem.
	  
	  The bigger problem of not using the sequences that are already on
	  these
	  tables to generate the IDs will not be an issue in 2.0, when we
	  move to
	  in-database ingest and can use the normal lastval() approach to
	  populate
	  asset.uri_call_number_map with the new values.

	* Backport r18516: Ensure call numbers are returned to the holdings
	  editor in ascending sorted order
	  
	  James Fournie in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/635121
	  reported
	  that call numbers were being displayed in the order that they had
	  been
	  added to the database, rather than in sorted call number label
	  order.
	  
	  Although I have been unable to reproduce this problem on two
	  different
	  test systems, the patch he provided for 1.6.1 (which fixes the
	  problem on their
	  test system) shouldn't hurt other systems.
