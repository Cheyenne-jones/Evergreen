    LP#1516707: Phrase search ignores CD modifiers
    
    Because phrases are subqueries, we need to look at the top of the parse tree
    when looking for modifiers for cover density.  This is because modifers are
    normally only allowed at the top of the parse tree (or in the floating sub-
    query).  We do that by asking the plan's QueryParse for it's reference to its
    parse_tree member, which is always the top of the parse tree in QP.
    
    Included in this commit is a small change to the QP testing script to
    facilitate testing of this fix.

    Fix LP1175711, OPAC can't renew item on booking resource list
    
    A test sequence to show the behaviour before and after the fix:
    
    1. Using staff client, check out an item to test account.
    2. Go to Copy Details on the OPAC, click Book Now, and cancel the form;
    the side effect is to put the item on the Resource list.
    3. Using the OPAC on a web browser, log in with test account.
    4. Go to Items Checked Out, select the item in the list and click Renew
    Selected Items.
    
    Before the fix, we saw the OPAC spin forever, and we saw the Javascript
    console of the web browser log the error noted in previous comments.
    
    With the fix, we see an error prompt saying, 'The system is unable to
    renew the selected item at this time.  This usually means the item is
    needed to fulfill a hold.  Please see a librarian for further help.'
    
    Note: A patron with the normal group of permissions will not be able to
    renew an item on resource list.
    
    The fix is to check for an error object emitted by the function
    Booking.pm/reservation_list_by_filters(), and to propagate it back to
    the client, by returning a call to bail_on_events().
    
    We also clarify the coding of the function's parameter list and how the
    function checks for mandatory parameters.

    LP#1513554 - Prevent deletion of reserved rows.
    
    It was previously possible to delete reserved rows in
    the acq.cancel_reasons table via the UI.  We take a belt
    and suspenders approach here:
    
    1) Grey out the checkboxes beside cancel reasons with an
       ID lower than 2000.
    2) Create a trigger on the acq.cancel_reason table that
       prevents deletion of rows with an ID lower than 2000.
    
    The trigger executes a new generally available function
    for use in similar situations in the future.

    LP#937789: various improvements to logical deletion of parts
    
    This patch ensures that when a monograph part is marked as
    deleted, that mappings between it and its copies are also
    removed, similar to the previous behavior of the cascade
    on delete.
    
    This patch also adds some pgTAP tests and ensures that
    unapi.bmp() and unapi.holdings_xml() get updated during upgrade.
    
    To test the fix for this bug:
    
    [1] Apply the patches.
    [2] Create a monograph part on a record, then delete it. Verify that
        it no longer shows up in the parts maintenance interface, but that
        a row in the biblio.monograph_parts table still exists with the
        deleted flag set to true.
    [3] Create another monograph part on the same record.
    [4] Create a new volume/copy and assign the part created in step
        3 to it. Verify that the part shown in step 2 is *not*
        included in the XUL part selector.
    [5] Place a part-level hold. Verify that the hold request
        is displayed correct in both the public catalog and the staff
        interface.
    [6] Delete the part created in step 3.
    [7] Verify that viewing the list of the patron's holds in the XUL staff
        client doesn't result in any 'network errors'.  Also verify that
        the hold request is still displayed in patron's view in the public
        catalog.
    [8] Using SQL or some other means, set the expire_time and
        prev_check_time of the test hold request to a couple days in the
        past, then run the hold targeter.  Verify that the hold gets
        cancelled for lack of a suitable copy to fill it.

    LP#937789: fake-delete support for monograph parts
    
    Unlike copies, call numbers, and bibs, parts can be directly removed from the
    database.  This has a negative impact on holds, in that the holds become not
    just orphaned, but broken entirely.  With this commit we bring part holds to
    parity with other hold types such that they can be system-canceled when their
    target goes away.  This will avoid spurious UI-level errors to staff.
    
    Conflicts: rel_2_8 does not contain the cataloging module for webstaff, commit
    amended.

    LP#1511828: sort proximities numerically when targeting holds
    
    The hold targeter had three instances of using lexical sorting
    rather than numerical sorting.
    
    Two of the instances affected hold targeting if proximity values were
    over 9.  Proximity values were being sorted lexically. For instance,
    1,2,5,11,15,100,120 was sorted as 1,100,11,120,15,2,5, causing
    interesting hold targeting results. Normally proximity doesn't go
    that high so it isn't a problem, but we were using proximity adjustments
    to strictly order locations so each location had a different proximity,
    driving the numbers above 9.
    
    One instance wasn't causing any current issue but could cause problems in
    the future if more best hold selection sort options are added to bring the
    total number of sort options over 9.
    
    Also included are some changes to reduce warnings in the logs
    suggested by Bill Erickson.  The sorting problem was found by
    Galen Charlton, thanks Galen.
    
    Testing Notes - to trigger this issue you need to have adjusted
      proximities over 9.
    
    1. Use proximity adjustment rules to add a +10 proximity adjustment to
      one item circ lib, Branch A and a +2 proximity adjustment to the
      item circ lib Branch B.
    
    2. Find a title with a copy at Branch A and B. Place a hold with a
      pickup location of Branch B.
    
    3. The copy at Branch A should get targeted since it has a proximity of
      12-14 (10+normal proximity) and Branch B has a proximity of 2
      (2+normal proximity).  12 gets sorted before 2 lexically.
    
    4. After the fix the copy at Branch B should get targeted since 2
      is sorted before 12.

    The order in which we determined what to 'selected' in the "Library"

    BR1).  That only gives us half the location group though, which is why
    it was bumping up a level.  Now, if we have a location group selected,
    it will use that first (since they don't have shortnames); the remaining
    select order will be the same.

    LP#1503782: fix horizontal scrollbar in MARC import queue inspector
    
    In the XUL client (and webstaff), attempting to view the contents
    of a MARC record import queue displays a table that, due to

    fixes that.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Create a bib queue that has at least a dozen records or so.
    [2] Inspect the contents of the queue, scroll to the bottom of
        the table, and interact with the horizontal scrollbar.
    [3] Observe that doing so typically results in jumping up
        to the top of the table.
    [4] Apply the patch, clear cache and refresh, and try step #2
        again.
    [5] This time, the horizontal scrollbar should act normally.

    LP#1406786: fix remapping copies during parts merge
    
    This patch fixes an issue with how copies are mapped
    on the target part when using "Merge Selected" in the
    Monograph Parts interface.
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Create some monograph parts on a record and assign
        some copies to use them.
    [2] Use the merge parts function to collapse all of the
        parts created in step 1 onto a single part.
    [3] Verify that the copies whose original parts were removed
        are now mapped onto the part that was the target of the
        merge.

    LP#1509479: fix infinite loop bug in QueryParser
    
    An unclosed phrase search that has a modifier can cause QueryParser to
    enter an infinite loop, tying up open-ils.storage backends.
    
    Examples of such searches include:
    
      -"cats and dogs
      subject:+"physical chemistry
    
    This patch fixes the bug by allowing the end of the query string
    to terminate a phrase (in addition to a quotation mark).
    
    To test:
    
    [1] Verify that the t/21-QueryParser.t unit test passes
    [2] To test in a *development* database, before applying the patch
        run one of the example queries.  Observe that no
        results are returned, and that one of the open-ils.storage
        drones is running at 100% CPU.
    [3] Apply the patch and restart the open-ils.storage service.
    [4] Try the query again; this time, it should return results
        immediately without causing an open-ils.storage drone to
        peg a CPU.

    LP 1502156: Fix marc_export error when dumping authorities.
    
    There is a chance that marc_export will attempt to call a nonexistent
    field on MARC::Record if an error occurs while exporting authority
    records.  The bug could only be triggered if a conversion error
    occurred while exporting the authority as either MARCXML or USMARC.
    
    The fix is to rename a couple of variables in the Marque::Authority->next
    method to be more like those used in Marque::Biblio->next.  This will have
    the side effect of making marc_export easier to maintain, since the
    variables used in one method will now have the same meaning as those
    in the other.
