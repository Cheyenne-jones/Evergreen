    LP#1670407 Add tests for xact_finish close/re-open
    
    Since this bug came about due to negative balance changes (and it was
    easier), this commit extends the existing negative balances test suite
    to include basic tests for checking both xact_finish conditions.
    
    One of these tests fails without the fix from the previous commit.

    LP#1670407 Lost checkin re-opens transaction
    
    Avoid re-closing a circulation that was re-opened during checkin because
    it acquired a non-zero balance.  This is typically caused by, for
    example, voiding a lost item fee during checkin and/or generating
    overdues for lost-then-found items.

    LP#1175293 Use filtered fund dropdown in funding source interface
    
    The exising interface for allocating to funds from a funding source
    view lists all funds by code only.  Since many (most?) orgs reuse
    fund codes year to year, you eventually end up with a bunch of
    dupes you cannot tell apart.
    
    Let's "borrow" an AutoFieldWidget to do the heavy lifting of creating
    a filtered list of active funds, and include the year for further
    user validation.
    
    This is inspired by a few other fund dropdowns, but may not be the
    best overall solution.

    In moving from the deprecated XML::LibXSLT::output_string() to output_as_chars(),

    We test both the case where an output encoding has been explicitly declared,
    as well as the case where an output encoding has not been explicitly declared.
    It was this subtle difference that was causing the problem with output_string().

    LP#1576435: Force "Include inactive patrons?" on patron reg duplicate search
    
    In the XUL client, duplicate patron checking in the patron registration
    interface now includes inactive patrons (see LP#1217052).  However, if
    you click on the link "Found X patron(s) with the same name," the
    resulting patron search does not always include inactive patrons by
    default (instead, the value of the "Include inactive patrons?" checkbox
    is cached from your last patron search, as usual).
    
    To prevent user confusion in this scenario, this commit forces the
    linked patron search in the XUL client to always include inactive
    patrons.

    Testing would entail setting up an FTP server that contains a

    using edi_fetcher.pl to try to retrieve the file.

    will likely return a 404. Since the url is being
    used in an html document, the html filter is
    sufficient and allows the url to work as intended.

    LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that failed parsing
    
    Avoid fetching and creating edi_message entries for EDI messages that
    the system cannot parse.
    
    In the event parsing failed due to a temporary condition (e.g. Ruby
    translator was not running), messages can be reprocessed by either
    deleting the offending edi_message row or setting its status to 'retry'.
    
    See previous commit ("LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that
    failed processing") for a more detailed explanation.

    LP#1662902: do not re-download EDI files that failed processing
    
    At present, the EDI fetcher ignores files (as determined by file
    name and EDI account details) that were already successfully
    processed. With this patch, ones that failed processing (e.g.,
    acq.edi_message.state = 'proc_error') previously are ignored
    as well.
    
    This is because most processing errors reflect conditions that
    require some sort of manual intervention on the part of the materials
    vendor or the Evergreen user; having edi_fetcher.pl simply redownload
    and attempt to process the file has no effect other than causing
    the acq.edi_message table to grow.
    
    With this patch, the appearance of rows in acq.edi_message whose
    state is 'proc_error' should be taken as a signal to the Evergreen
    admin to investigate and resolve whatever issue caused the
    message to not be processed; after doing that, removing the
    acq.edi_message rows will allow the file to be downloaded again
    (assuming it's still available on the file server).
    
    To test
    -------
    [1] Arrange to create or simulate an EDI message that failed
        processing.
    [2] Run edi_fetcher.pl to have it attempt to download the
        failed message in step #1; verify that the file is
        /not/ downloaded again and that no additonal acq.edi_message
        rows are created for it.
