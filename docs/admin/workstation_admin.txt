Copy Editor: Copy Location Name First
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[copy editor, shelving location]

By default, when editing item records, library code is displayed in front of
shelving location in _Shelving Location_ field. You may reverse the order by going
to *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Copy Editor: Copy Location Name
First*.
Simply click it to make copy location name displayed first. The setting is saved
on the workstation.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, fonts, zooming]
indexterm:[staff client, sounds]

In the Staff Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may change the size of displayed text or turn staff client sounds on
and off. These settings are specific to each workstation and stored on
local hard disk. They do not affect OPAC font sizes.

. Select *Admin -> Workstation Administration ->  Global Font and Sound
Settings*.
. To turn off the system sounds, like the noise that happens when a patron
with a block is retrieved, check the _disable sound_ box and click _Save
to Disk_.
+

. To change the size of the font, pick the desired option and click _Save
to Disk_.

In the OPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is also possible to zoom in and zoom out when viewing the OPAC in the
staff client, making the font appear larger or smaller. (This will not
affect other screens.) Use *CTRL + +* (plus sign, to zoom in), *CTRL + -*
(minus sign, to zoom out), and *CTRL + 0* (to restore default). The
workstation will remember the setting.

Select Hotkeys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, hotkeys]

All or partial hotkeys can be turned on or off. It can be done for a particular 
workstation: 

. Navigate to *Admin -> Workstation Administration ->  Hotkeys -> Current*. 
. Select _Default_, _Minimal_, and _None_.
+
image::media/workstation_admin-3.png[select hotkeys]
+  
* *Default*: including all hotkeys
* *Minimal*: including those hotkeys using CTRL key
* *None*: excluding all hotkeys
+
. Go back to the above menu. 
. Click *Set Workstation Default to Current*. 

To clear the existing default click *Clear Workstation Default*.

You can use the *Toggle Hotkeys* button, included in some toolbars, on top right
corner, to switch your selected Hotkeys  _on_ or
_off_ for the current login session.
It has the same effect as when you click *Disable Hotkeys* on the _Hotkeys_ menu.

Configure Printers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[staff client, printers]

Use the Printer Settings Editor to configure printer output for each
workstation. If left unconfigured Evergreen will use the default printer set in
the workstation's operating system (Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, etc).

Evergreen printing works best if you are using recent, hardware-specific printer
drivers.

. Select *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Printer Settings Editor*.
. Select the _Printer Context_. At a minimum set the _Default_ context on each
Evergreen workstation. Repeat the procedure for other contexts if they differ
from the default (e.g. if spine labels should output to a different printer.
+ 
image::media/workstation_admin-4.png[printer context]
+
* *Default*: Default settings for staff client print functions (set for each
workstation). 
* *Receipt*: Settings for printing receipts.
* *Label*: Printer settings for spine and pocket labels.
* *Mail*: Settings for printing mailed notices (not yet active).
* *Offline*: Applies to all printing from the Offline Interface.
+
. After choosing _Printer Context_ click *Set Default Printer* and *Print Test
Page* and follow the prompts. If successful, test output will print to your chosen
printer. 
+
image::media/workstation_admin-5.png[set default printer]
+
. (optional) To further format or customize printed output click *Page Settings* and
adjust settings. When finished click *OK* and print another test page to view
changes.

Advanced Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you followed the steps above and still cannot print there are two alternate
print strategies: 

* DOS LPTI Print (sends unformatted text directly to the parallel port)
* Custom/External Print (configuration required)

[NOTE]
====================================
Evergreen cannot print using the Windows Generic/Text Only driver. If this
driver is the only one available try one of the alternate print strategies
instead.
====================================

Receipt Template Editor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

indexterm:[receipt template editor]
indexterm:[receipt template editor, macros]
indexterm:[receipt template editor, checkout]

There are many default receipt templates included with the Evergreen staff
client. These templates are saved on individual workstations. Customization can be
done workstation by workstation or by exporting the templates to import to other
workstations.

. Select *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Receipt Template Editor*.
. Select the _checkout_ template from the dropdown menu.
+    
image::media/receipt-2.png[select checkout]
+
. This is what the default checkout template looks like.  The template preview is
on the left hand side.  You can edit the _Header_, _Line Item_ or _Footer_ on the 
right hand side.  
+    
image::media/receipt-3.jpg[receipt-3]
+
. In the upper right hand corner you can see the available macros by clicking on
the *Macros* button.  A macro prints a real value from the database.  In this
example, the macro _%LIBRARY%_ prints ``Prince Rupert Library''.  The macros that
are available vary slightly between types of receipt templates (i.e. bills,
holds, items). 
+
[TIP]
===============================
Receipt templates are marked up with HTML tags. You may use most HTML tags.
See http://www.w3schools.com/html/ for more information on HTML tags.  

You may insert a link to an image, e.g. your library's logo, that exists on the
web. For example, to include the white Evergreen logo from this document, enter tag <img
src=http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.3/media/small_logo_white.jpg>. in the
receipt template.

There are several macros that can carry pre-built contents specific to
individual libraries. The contents can be set up in local administration. For
details see <<library_settings_editor, Library Settings>>. Though text can be hard-coded in receipt
templates, the pre-built contents will be automatically applied to receipts
printed from all workstations without editing each template.

* %INCLUDE(notice_text)%
* %INCLUDE(alert_text)%
* %INCLUDE(event_text)%
* %INCLUDE(footer_text)%%
* %INCLUDE(header_text)%
==============================
+
. Below are some example edits:
+    
image::media/receipt-11.jpg[receipt-11]
+
The above is the default _Line Item_ in Checkout template. The macro _%barcode%_
prints the item barcodes of the books that were checked out.  The macro
_%due_date%_ prints the due date for each item that was checked out. You may add a
line break between them: Barcode: _%barcode%_ </br> Due: _%due_date%_
+
The receipt preview will look like this:
+    
image::media/receipt-11a.png[receipt-11a]
+
[NOTE]
==========================
The due date can only be printed in the _YYYY-MM-DD_ format. 
==========================  
+
. Once you have the checkout template how you want it, click *Save Locally* to
save the template to your computer.

Print Holds Slip with Landscape Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


indexterm:[receipt template editor, holds receipt, layout]

This feature enables you to use Mozilla-specific CSS to print holds with a
landscape layout. To use the landscape layout:

. Click *Admin* -> *Workstation Administration* -> *Receipt Template Editor*.
. Select *hold transit slip* from the *Template Name* drop down menu.
. Enter <div> before and after the block of text that you wish to rotate.
. Enter the stylesheet text in the <div> bracket that appears before the block
of text that you wish to rotate:  
+
[source, html]
------------------------
<div style="moz-transform: rotate(90deg);">
------------------------
+
. When you click out of this box, notice that the text in the *Preview* box on
the left side of the screen has rotated 90 degrees.
. You can further customize the look of the text by adjusting its height and
width.  The height and width that you specify will be unique to your printer.
For example, you could add the following height and width to your rotated text:
+
[source, html]
------------------------
<div style="moz-transform: rotate(90deg);height: 300px; width: 200px;">
------------------------
+
image::media/Print_Holds_Slip1.jpg[Print_Holds_Slip1]
+
. The holds slip will print with the configured text in a landscape layout:
+
image::media/Print_Holds_Slip2.jpg[Print_Holds_Slip2] 

Exporting Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[receipt template editor, exporting]

As you can only save a template on to the computer you are working on you will
need to export the template if you have more than one computer that prints out
receipts (e.g. more than one computers on the circulation desk, or another
computer in the workroom that you use to checkin items or capture holds with).

. Click on *Export*.
+
image::media/receipt-17.jpg[receipt-17]
+
. Select the location to save the template to, name the template, and click
*Save*.
. Click *OK* to confirm.

Importing Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

indexterm:[receipt template editor, importing]

. Send the exported templates file to the workstation to which you want to import
the templates. You may do it using memory stick or email, etc.
. On _Receipt Template Editor_, Click *Import*. 
+ 
image::media/receipt-20.jpg[receipt-20]
+
. Navigate to and select the template file that you want to import.  Click
*Open*.
+ 
image::media/receipt-21.jpg[receipt-21]
+
. Click *OK* to confirm on the prompt.
+
. Click *Save Locally*.

image::media/receipt-23.jpg[receipts-23]

[TIP]
=================
By default all libraries use shared and hard-coded templates for Hold Slip and
Transit Slip. Libraries can switch to using their own templates by setting up a
library setting: Use legacy hardcoded receipts/slips. Details see <<library_settings_editor, Library Settings>>. 
=================


Customizable Toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, two toolbars are available in the staff client: circulation and
cataloging. This feature enables you to customize toolbars in the staff client.
You can create toolbars for specific org unit(s), workstation(s), or login(s).

Configure Toolbar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

. Click *Admin* -> *Workstation Administration* -> *Toolbars* -> *Configure
Toolbars*.

. Click *New Toolbar*.

. Enter label for toolbar.
+
image::media/Customizable_Toolbar1.jpg[Customizable_Toolbar1]
+
. Click *Ok*.

. Select one of the buttons in the *Available* panel.  The *Button ID* describes
that action that the button will take, and the *Label* will display in the
toolbar.

. Click the `--> (A)` button to add the selected function to the
*Selected* panel on the bottom right side of the screen.  To remove a button,
click the `<-- (R)` button.
+
image::media/Customizable_Toolbar2.jpg[Customizable_Toolbar2]
+
. Continue adding buttons if desired.  The buttons will display in the order that you add
them.  If you want to reorder the buttons, click the *Up* or *Down* buttons.

. To separate buttons onto left and right sides of the screen on the same
toolbar, select *toolbarspacer*, and click `--> (A)`.
+
image::media/Customizable_Toolbar3.jpg[Customizable_Toolbar3]
+
. To add a dividing line between buttons that appear on the same side of the
screen, select *toolbarseparator*, and click `--> (A)`.
+
image::media/Customizable_Toolbar4.jpg[Customizable_Toolbar4]
+
. At the bottom of the screen, choose the owner of this toolbar.
If you click *Owning Org Unit*, then the owning org unit that you specify will display this
toolbar.  Select the owning org unit from the drop down menu.  The rule of
parental inheritance applies, so all child units will inherit the toolbars of
their parental units.
If you click *Owning Workstation*, then the workstation to which you are logged
in when you created the toolbar will display this toolbar.
If you select *Owning User*, then your login has access to that toolbar.

. When you are finished creating the toolbar, click *Save Toolbar*.  Any
toolbar to which you have access displays under *Admin -> Workstation
Administration -> Toolbars -> Current*.
