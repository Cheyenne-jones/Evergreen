When data is displayed in columns, you can click and drag them, add new
ones, or remove them. You can also sort data in a column by clicking on
the column header. After customizing the display you may save your changes
for future sessions under that login by right-clicking anywhere in the
display area and choosing *Save Columns* from the drop-down menu. Some
libraries use generic accounts and for those who do, staff need to be
aware of the implications to other staff members of any changes made to
the display.

Some lists have a different design, and some of them can also be customized.
Simply right-click the header row of any of the columns, and the column
picker will appear. When you are finished customizing the display, scroll
to the bottom of the Column Picker window and click *Save*.
