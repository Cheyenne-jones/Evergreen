Upgrade notes
-------------

Record Attributes Reingest Recommended
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After this update, it is recommended that you reingest your
bibliographic records to update the fixed field, record attribute
indexes.  This is mainly necessary to make sure that fiction books do
not also show up as non-fiction.

You can accomplish this by running the following query in your database:

[source,sql]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
select metabib.reingest_record_attributes(id)
from biblio.record_entry;
--------------------------------------------------------------------



New features
------------



Acquisitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~



Acquisitions speed improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Improvements to the rendering of the acquisitions fund selector will improve
the speed at which the purchase order, copy grid, PO/invoice charge creator,
and distribution formula editor load. These speed improvements will be most
noticeable for sites that use a lot of funds.






Differentiate Delayed vs Canceled Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Background
++++++++++
Canceled and delayed lineitems and copies in acquisitions are marked as
canceled in the database.  The determining factor of whether an item is
delayed or canceled is the keep_debits flag on the cancel reason.  

The changes below help to differentiate between these two closely related 
states by improving labels in the interface and providing separate counts
for delayed vs. canceled.

Changes
+++++++

 * Show number canceled and number delayed in lineitem summary displays
  ** Includes summary displays in invoices and copy grids
 * Update stock cancel cause labels to include "Canceled:.." and 
   "Delayed:..." prefixes.
 * When a lineitem or copy is marked as canceled, show the cancel cause
   label in the interface instead of the bare (and misleading and non-I18N 
   friendly) string "cancelled".
   ** Related, for non-canceled states, show a translatable string 
     representing the name of the state instead of the bare state code.
 * Add cancel cause labels to the print PO and lineitem worksheet templates.

Support Cancellation of Delayed Lineitems
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a lineitem is marked as delayed (canceled with keep_debits == true), 
allow staff to cancel the lineitem again in the ACQ PO/Picklist interface.
Once a lineitem is marked as truly canceled, it cannot be canceled again.




Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Switch to XLSX format for Excel report output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With previous versions of Evergreen, reports generated in the Excel output
were limited to a maximum of 64,000 rows.  This was a limitation due to the 
Excel format ".xls". Now, new report outputs for Excel will use format ".xlsx"
which allows for much larger report output rows.





Report Editing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users may now view and edit existing reports.

With each report in the Reports folder view there are two new links,
one for viewing (read-only) and one for editing.  After changing a 
report, the user has the option to save the modified report
or create a new report with the new values, in effect cloning
the original report.

When saving a changed report, if a pending report run exists, the user
will be warned of this and asked if they would prefer to modify the
scheduled report or to instead save the changed values as a new 
report, leaving the original report intact.




Reports Documentation Links and Hints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * Report templates support a new External URL field, which may
   contain a link to template-specific, local documentation.

  ** When set, a link to the external documentation will be
     displayed in a new column in the template list and within
     the report editor.

  ** URL's are set in the 'Documentation URL' entry.

 * Template display fields and filters support a new Field Hint
   value.  When set, hints are displayed in the report editor.

  ** Values are set via the 'Change Field Hint' option along
     the bottom of the template editor.






Secondary Permission Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Secondary permission groups, available through the patron editor, allow admins
to add supplemental permission groups to staff accounts. The
*CREATE_USER_GROUP_LINK* and *REMOVE_USER_GROUP_LINK* permissions are required
to display and use this feature. 

<<secondaryperms, View Documentation>>.






Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~



TPAC Copy View/Edit Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adds 'view' and 'edit' links next to each copy in the TPAC record
details copy grid when viewed from within the staff client.  The 'edit'
link only appears when the authenticated user has permission to edit the
specified copy.

Both links open new tabs.  When the 'edit' link used, the 'Unified
Volume/Item Creator/Editor' org unit setting is inspected to determine
which style of copy edit interface to display.




Display "Imported As" in Vandelay Queue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This simple new feature appears within the Cataloging *MARC Batch 
Import/Export* screens. When viewing the contents of a Vandelay queue, 
for example when inspecting a queue or right after bib imports, there is 
a new column displayed called _Imported As_. This new column displays the 
record ID, also known as the bib number, of the bib records currently 
listed in the queue. If the bib records listed in the queue have not been 
imported yet, this column is blank until the queued records are imported. 
After import the queued records will display the assigned record ID for 
the listed bib(s).




MARC Stream Importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New command line options were added to marc_stream_importer.pl for
passing additional Vandelay import flags.  Prior to this change, only
auto-overlay-exact was supported.  

New options:

  * --auto-overlay-exact
    ** Overlay/merge on exact 901c matches
  * --auto-overlay-1match
    ** Overlay/merge when exactly one match is found
  * --auto-overlay-best-match
    ** Overlay/merge on best match
  * --import-no-match
    ** Import when no match is found

Like Vandelay, these options can be combined.




Monograph Part Merging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The monograph part list for a bibliographic record may, over time, diverge from the
proscribed format, resulting in multiple labels for what are essentially the same
item.  For instance, ``++Vol.{nbsp}1++'' may have variants like ``++V.1++'', ``++Vol{nbsp}1++'', or ``++{nbsp}Vol.{nbsp}1++'' (leading space).
This feature will allow catalog staff to collapse the variants into one value.

In the Monograph Parts display:

. Click the checkbox for all items you wish to merge including the one you wish to prevail when done.
. Click on the ``Merge Selected'' button. A pop-up window will list the selected items in
a monospaced font, with blanks represented by a middle-dot character for more visibility.
. Click on the item you wish to prevail.

The undesired part labels will be deleted, and any copies that previously used those labels will 
now use the prevailing label.




Circulation
~~~~~~~~~~~



Change to Holds Shelf Expire Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When limiting to Clearable Holds in the Browse Holds Shelf interface, the
system will no longer display and clear holds expiring today. Instead, it will
look for holds that expired before today.




Support holds targeting and fullfillment of precats for ILL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adds support for holds targeting and fullfillment of copy-level holds on
pre-cat records. This feature makes integration with FulfILLment, NCIP and
other ILL mediators easier because pre-cat copies can sucessfully be used for
the ILL records.





Support for a Lost and Paid Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature supports a new, optional, _Lost and Paid_ status that can be used
by sites that want to distinguish between lost items with outstanding bills and
those that have been fully paid. A site may want to make this distinction to
set different OPAC visibility or holdability rules for these items.

If enabled, when a lost item is fully paid, the copy's status will automatially
change to _Lost and Paid_.

New setting available via the Library Settings Editor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Use Lost and Paid copy status (circ.use_lost_paid_copy_status)




OPAC
~~~~



Added Content by Record ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Template Toolkit OPAC will now load all Added Content by the Record ID, not
just jacket images. This will allow added content providers that support it to
load additional content by other identifiers.




Content Cafe Added Content Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::ContentCafe provider has been updated to use the
newer Content Cafe 2 API in full. With this update the ability to load content
based on ISBN or UPC is now enabled.


"No Image" Images
+++++++++++++++++
With the updated code the option for displaying a "No Image" image or a 1x1
pixel image is no longer available. Instead the Apache-level "blank image" rules
will trigger when no image is available. The configuration option controlling
this behavior can thus be removed from opensrf.xml entirely.


Identifier Selection
++++++++++++++++++++
By default the module will prefer ISBNs over UPCs, but will request information
for both. If you wish for UPCs to be preferred, or wish one of the two
identifier types to not be considered at all, you can change the
"identifier_order" option in opensrf.xml. When the option is present only the
identifier(s) listed will be sent.




More RDA 264 tag support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OPAC now displays RDA bib tag 264 information for Producer, Distributor, 
Manufacturer, and Copyright within a full bib recordâ€™s summary. This is in 
addition to the RDA bib tag 264 publisher information, indicator 2 equal 
to 1, that was already being displayed in previous versions of Evergreen. 
The OPAC full bib view also now contains the Schema.org copyrightYear value.

Additionally, this information is now available in search results as well 
when viewing more details.




Sitemap generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A http://www.sitemaps.org[sitemap] directs search engines to the pages of
interest in a web site so that the search engines can intelligently crawl
your site. In the case of Evergreen, the primary pages of interest are the
bibliographic record detail pages.

The sitemap generator script creates sitemaps that adhere to the
http://sitemaps.org specification, including:

* limiting the number of URLs per sitemap file to no more than 50,000 URLs;
* providing the date that the bibliographic record was last edited, so
  that once a search engine has crawled all of your sites' record detail pages,
  it only has to reindex those pages that are new or have changed since the last
  crawl;
* generating a sitemap index file that points to each of the sitemap files.

Running the sitemap generator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The `sitemap_generator` script must be invoked with the following argument:

* `--lib-hostname`: specifies the hostname for the catalog (for example,
  `--lib-hostname https://catalog.example.com`); all URLs will be generated
  appended to this hostname

Therefore, the following arguments are useful for generating multiple sitemaps
per Evergreen instance:

* `--lib-shortname`: limit the list of record URLs to those which have copies
  owned by the designated library or any of its children;
* `--prefix`: provides a prefix for the sitemap index file names

Other options enable you to override the OpenSRF configuration file and the
database connection credentials, but the default settings are generally fine.

Note that on very large Evergreen instances, sitemaps can consume hundreds of
megabytes of disk space, so ensure that your Evergreen instance has enough room
before running the script.

Scheduling
++++++++++
To enable search engines to maintain a fresh index of your bibliographic
records, you may want to include the script in your cron jobs on a nightly or
weekly basis.

Sitemap files are generated in the same directory from which the script is
invoked, so a cron entry will look something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 2 * * * cd /openils/var/web && /openils/bin/sitemap_generator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
