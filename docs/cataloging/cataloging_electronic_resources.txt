Cataloging Electronic Resources -- Finding Them in Catalog Searches
-------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to make electronic resources visible in the catalog without
adding copies to the record:

. Adding a Located URI to the record
. Attaching the record to a bib source that is transcendent

The Located URI approach is useful for Evergreen sites where libraries have
access to different electronic resources. The transcendent bib source approach
is useful if all of your libraries have access to the same electronic resources.

Another difference between the two approaches is that electronic resources with
Located URI's never appear in results where the search is limited to a specific
copy location(s). In contrast, transcendent electronic resources will appear in
results limited to any copy location.

Adding a Located URI to the Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Located URI allows you to add the short name for the owning library to
indicate which organizational units should be able to find the resource. The
owning organizational unit can be a branch, system, or consortium. The resource
will then appear in search results in the following situations:

* When the user's search scope is set at the owning organizational unit or to
a child of the owning organizational unit, the record will appear in search
results.
* When a logged-in user's preferred search library is set to the owning
organizational unit or to a child of that owning organizational unit, the record
will appear regardless of search scope.

To add a located URI to the record:

. Open the record in _MARC Edit_
. Add a subfield 9 to the 856 field of the record and enter the short name of 
the organizational unit for the value. Make sure there is a 4 entered as the
first indicator and a 0 entered as the second indicator. 
For example:
+
'856 40 $u http://lwn.net $y Linux Weekly News $9 BR1'
+
would make this item visible to people searching in a library scope of BR1 or to
logged-in users who have set BR1 as their preferred search library.
+
[NOTE]
If multiple organizational units own the resource, you can enter more than one
subfield 9 to the 856 field or you can enter multiple 856 fields with a subfield
9 to the record 
+
. Save the record

Using Transcendent Bib Sources for Electronic Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Connecting a bib record to a transcendent bib source will make the record
visible in search results regardless of the user's search scope.

To start, you need to create a transcendent bib source by adding it to
'config.bib_source' in the Evergreen database and setting the _transcendant_ 
field to true. For example:

+# INSERT INTO config.bib_source(quality, source, transcendant, can_have_copies)
VALUES (50, `ebooks', TRUE, FALSE);+

[NOTE]
If you want to allow libraries to add copies to these records, set the
_can_have_copies_ field to _TRUE_. If you want to prevent libraries from adding
copies to these records, set the _can_have_copies_ field to _FALSE_.

When adding or uploading bib records for electronic resources, set the
bibliographic source for the record to this transcendent bibliographic source.
Using the staff client, the bibliographic source can be selected in the _MARC
Batch Import_ interface when importing new, non-matching records or in the
_MARC Edit_ interface when editing existing records.
