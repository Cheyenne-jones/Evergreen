Library Links from Copy Details
-------------------------------

An Evergreen site can configure the catalog to provide links to a library's web
site from the copy details section of the search results page, the record
summary page, and the kids catalog record summary page. These links allow a
patron to quickly access branch information, such as the location, hours of
operation, and/or contact information.

To configure the links:

. Go to *Admin* -> *Local Administration* -> *Library Settings Editor*
. Edit the *Library Information URL* setting for the branch.
[NOTE]
If you set the URL at the system level, that URL will be used as the link for
all child branches.
. Enter the URL in the following format: http://example.com/about.html
[NOTE]
If a branch or its parent does not have a Library Information URL set, the
branch name will display as normal text.
