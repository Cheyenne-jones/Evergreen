Release notes
=============

Upgrade notes
-------------

Located URI search scope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recognizing that electronic resources are often licensed for an entire library
system rather than just a single library, the search scope for located URIs has
changed to match from the highest point in the hierarchy down, rather than from
the bottom up. In previous releases of Evergreen, if you had a MARC record with
a URI located at 'BR1', a search for that record at the 'SYS1' scope would
include the record in its results. The current release of Evergreen would not
include the record in its results; the scope needs to be set at the level of
'BR1' in the hierarchy or below.

Therefore, you may want to run a SQL statement like the following, edited to
match the short names of your branches and systems, to change the located
URIs so that searches at the system level continue to return results for
located URIs:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE biblio.record_entry
    SET marc = replace(
        replace(
            marc, 
            '<subfield code="9">BR1</subfield>',
            '<subfield code="9">SYS1</subfield>'
        ),
        '<subfield code="9">BR3</subfield>',
        '<subfield code="9">SYS2</subfield>'
    ) WHERE marc LIKE '<subfield code="9">BR1</subfield>'
        OR marc LIKE '<subfield code="9">BR3</subfield>'
;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Z39.50 server definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Z39.50 server target definitions have been removed from the sample
`opensrf.xml.example` file. To migrate existing settings from your
`opensrf.xml` configuration file to the database, peform the
following steps:

    1. First, set up your custom Z39.50 sources in the database. For
      each entry in `z3950/services`, map the following XML paths to the
      corresponding `config.z3950_source` table column as follows:
+
      ** `z3950/services/<entry>` = name
      ** `//<entry>/name` = label
      ** `//<entry>/host` = host
      ** `//<entry>/port` = port
      ** `//<entry>/db` = db
      ** `//<entry>/record_format` = record_format
      ** `//<entry>/transmission_format` = transmission_format
+
    2. Then, for each attribute defined in the `<attrs>` element for
       a given service, map the following XML paths to the corresponding
       `config.z3950_attr` table column as follows:
+
      ** `z3950/services/<entry>` = source
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>` = name
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>/code` = code
      ** `//<entry>/attrs/<attr>/format` = format
+
    3. After adding the new Z39.50 sources and corresponding attributes,
       you will need to log out of the staff client and log back into the
       staff client to retrieve the new entry values. If a given Z39.50
       server does not work for a given attribute, pay attention to the
       `truncation` column for the attribute.


New features
------------

OPAC
~~~~

Copy Location Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature allows staff to create and name sets of copy locations to use as
a search filter in the catalog.  OPAC-visible groups will display within the
library selector in the template toolkit OPAC.  When a user selects a group
and performs a search, the set of results will be limited to records that have
copies in one of the copy locations within the group.  Groups can live at any
level of the library hierarchy and may include copy locations from any parent 
org unit or child org unit.

For advanced users, this change includes a new Query Parser filter called
location_groups().

Cataloging
~~~~~~~~~~

Prevent bibliographic records from having attached copies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To enable libraries to designate specific sets of records as only for use
as electronic resources, it is possible to configure a bibliographic source
such that physical copies or MFHD records may not be attached to records
from that source. The `config.bib_source` table now includes a new Boolean
column, `can_have_copies`, that controls this behavior. If `can_have_copies`
for a given bibliographic source is `TRUE`, then the staff client will prevent
a cataloger from adding volumes or MFHD records to records belonging to that
source.

Switch copy location name and library short name in copy editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default, the copy editor shows the library shortname ('BR1' or 'CONS')
followed by the copy location name ('Stacks', 'Reference').  A new workstation
setting, under *Admin -> Workstation Administration -> Copy Editor: Copy
Location Name First*, enables staff to change the display so that the copy
location name is displayed first, followed by the library shortname. This
may be particularly useful for libraries that have defined one set of copy
locations at the consortial level and want to enable quick keyboard navigation
to copy locations by typing just the first letters of the copy location.

Authentication proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To support integration of Evergreen with organizational authentication systems,
and to reduce the proliferation of user names and passwords, Evergreen offers 
a new service called `open-ils.auth_proxy`. If you enable the service,
`open-ils.auth_proxy` supports different authentication mechanisms
that implement the `authenticate` method. You can define a chain of these
authentication mechanisms to be tried in order within the `<authenticators>`
element of the `opensrf.xml` configuration file, with the option of falling
back to the `native` mode that uses Evergreen's internal method of password
authentication.

This service only provides authentication; there is no support for automatic
provisioning of accounts. To authenticate against any authentication system,
the user account must first be defined within the Evergreen system, and
authentication will be based on the user name as it exists in Evergreen.

A sample authentication mechanism for LDAP is provided in
`Open-ILS::Application::AuthProxy::LDAP_AUTH`, and corresponding sample
attributes can be found in `opensrf.xml.example`.

Reports
~~~~~~~

New views for reporting sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To support the creation of collection development reports, the following
reporting sources have been added:

  * 'Last Circulation or Creation Date' is a source that offers the copy ID,
    the last circulation date or creation date, and the last circulation date
  * 'Hold/Copy Ratio per Bib and Pickup Library' is a source that calculates
    the number of holds per copy per bibliographic record, with granularity
    by pickup library.
