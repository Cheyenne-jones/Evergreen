Place Multiple Holds At Once
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users with the appropriate permissions now have the ability to place multiple
title/metarecords holds at once. This feature is especially beneficial for book
clubs and reading groups, which need to place holds on multiple copies of a 
title.

In order to use the feature:
  * Set the _Maximum number of duplicate holds allowed_ Library Setting (
circ.holds.max_duplicate_holds) to a number higher than 1
  * Log in as a user with the CREATE_DUPLICATE_HOLDS

When placing a title or metarecord hold, a _Number of copies_ field will 
display for these users. This field is not available when placing part, volume
or copy holds. 

This feature does not change the way in which the system fills holds. The
multiple holds will fill in the same way that they would if the user had placed
multiple holds separately.
