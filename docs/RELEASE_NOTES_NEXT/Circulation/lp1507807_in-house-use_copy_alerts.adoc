Display Copy Alerts With In-House-Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two library settings are used to control the display of copy alert
messages or copy location check in alerts when recording in-house-use
in Evergreen.

Setting 'Display copy alert for in-house-use' to true for an
organization will cause an alert to appear with the copy's alert
message, if it has one, when recording in-house-use for the copy.

Setting 'Display copy location check in alert for in-house-use' to true
for an organization will cause an alert to display a message
indicating that the item needs to be routed to its location if the
location has check in alert set to true.

The settings are independent of one another because you may want to
display one and not the other when recording in-house-use.
