Patron Search by Birth Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Now you can include the patron birth year and/or birth month and/or
  birth day when searching for patrons using the web based staff client.
* Day and month values are exact matches.  E.g. month "1" (or "01")
  matches January, "12" matches December.
* Year searches are "contains" searches.  E.g. year "15" matches 2015,
  1915, 1599, etc.  For exact matches use the full 4-digit year.
