Selfcheck Inactivity Warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Selfcheck interface now warns patrons when they are about to be
logged out due to inactivity 20 seconds prior to logging them out.

The inactivity timeout is also reset with each checkout to avoid timeouts 
while checking out lots of items.
