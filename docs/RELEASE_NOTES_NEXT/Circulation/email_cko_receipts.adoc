Email Checkout Receipts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature allows patrons to receive checkout receipts through email
at the circulation desk and in the Evergreen self-checkout interface.
Patrons need to opt in to receive email receipts by default and must
have an email address associated with their account. Opt in can be staff
mediated at the time of account creation or in existing accounts.
Patrons can also opt in directly in their OPAC account or through patron
self-registration. This feature does not affect the behavior of
checkouts from SIP2 devices.

Patrons can opt in to receipt email checkout receipts by default via
a new "Email checkout reciepts by default" patron setting.

This feature also enhances the patron staging tables so that patron
settings can be chosen during self-registration.

The web staff interface's checkout screen now includes a "Quick
Receipt" button that allows staff members to generate a receipt
at any time.
