Alternate Patron Hold Pickup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature adds a bit of convenience to a common task: checking out
an item on hold to another patron (typically a family member or helper).

When you checkout the item, you will get a pop-up window with warnings associated
with this item.  The "ITEM_ON_HOLDS_SHELF" message is now expanded to

 * Let you know the name of the person who had placed the hold.
 * Give you the option (in the form of a checkbox) of cancelling the
   hold placed by the above-named patron.  (Checked = Cancel the hold;
   Unchecked = Leave the hold in place)

The initial value of the checkbox is derived from the circ.clear_hold_on_checkout
organizational setting.

If the operator has CANCEL_HOLD privilege, then if the checkbox is checked and
the checkout is allowed to proceed, the hold will be cancelled with a note that
the item was checked out to another patrron.

This feature is available in the browser-based staff client.
