Conditional Negative Balances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen sites will now have more control over whether a negative balance can
be applied to a user's billing record and when that negative balance can be 
applied. Through a series of Library Settings, a site can prohibit negative
balances on bills or can allow those negative balances to be applied for a
specific period of time after a lost or overdue bill is charged to the user.
Sites can set a default for all types of bills or can apply distinct settings
for lost bills and for overdue fines. The more specific settings will override
the default. 

Sites that opt to allow negative balances for a specific period of time must
1) enable the relevant "prohibit negative balances" setting(s) and 2) specify
the time period in the relevant Negative Balance Interval setting(s).  

In addition to the new library settings, the system now has a new account 
adjustment payment type. This payment type will be utilized for libraries 
prohibiting negative balances to replace the previous voiding behavior that 
caused the negative balances to occur. The account adjustment payment type will
also be used for all libraries, regardless of the state of negative balance
settings, in cases where overdue fines are adjusted when an overdue item is
marked lost.

An _Adjust to Zero_ option has been added to the bills interface of the patron
record. This option will always adjust the selected bill to a zero balance.
It can also be used to easily clear a negative balance from the patron's
record. A user must have the new ADJUST_BILLS permission to see and use this
option.

This new feature also changes the behavior for the client option to void a bill
from the patron record. If a user does not have the VOID_BILLING permission, the
option to void bills will be hidden in the bills interface and in the Full 
Details view of a specific bill. 

To truly remove the ability to produce negative balances on a transaction,
administrators need to 1) enable the relevant setting in the Library Settings
Editor and 2) remove the VOID_BILLING permission from staff accounts since
manual voiding will continue to produce negative balances.
