==== Non-Active Status Copy Transit Message ====

After copy checkin, if the copy is in-transit, display a special
message in the transit alert dialog and in the printed transit receipt
(optionally, via macro) if the copy is in (or, rather, will be once it
arrives at its destination) a non-active copy status.

===== Upgrade Notes =====

 * To add the new message to the transit slip, add the
   'transit_copy_status_msg' MACRO.
 * To remove the new message from the alert dialog, remove the 
   'staff.circ.utils.transit.copy_status_message' string property
   from 'Open-ILS/xul/staff_client/server/locale/LOCALE/circ.properties'
 * For a list of non-active copy statuses, see in the staff client
   under Admin -> Server Administration -> Copy Statuses.
