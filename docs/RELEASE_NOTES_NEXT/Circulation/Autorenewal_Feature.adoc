Autorenewal of Loans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Circulation policies in Evergreen can now be configured to automatically renew
certain items checked out on patron accounts. Circulations will be renewed
automatically up to a custom limit (the `max_auto_renewal` field) and patrons
will not need to log in to their OPAC accounts or ask library staff to manually
renew materials.

Two new action triggers have been added to Evergreen that permit the Auto-Renew
feature. They can be found, configured, and enabled in Administration>Local
Administration>Notifications/Action Triggers. They are named **Autorenew** and
**AutorenewNotify**.

The **Autorenew** A/T definition uses the `checkout.due` hook to automatically
validate and renew (in the reactor) circulations on the day they are due,
grouped by user. The output events of this definition is is the input used by
the related **AutorenewNotify** A/T that simply uses a new hook called
`autorenewal` to notify patrons via email of their currently due or
auto-renewed items.

In the webstaff's Patron Items Out page, the new column `AutoRenewalsRemaining`
indicates how many autorenewals are available for a particular circulation.
