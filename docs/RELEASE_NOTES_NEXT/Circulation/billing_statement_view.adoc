New Patron Billing Statement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Evergreen web staff client now includes a patron billing statement,
which summarizes a patron's bills, credits and payments in a familiar
layout.  This can be found on the "Statement" tab of the Patron Bill
Details page. (From the Patron Bills page, double-click a row to view
its details, or choose "Full Details" from the Actions menu.)
