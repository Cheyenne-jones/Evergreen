Copy Status "Is Available" Flag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new boolean field is now available for copy statuses to indicate when copies
having a given status should be considered available.  The field has 2 main
effects:

1. Checking out an "available" copy will no longer result in an override-able
   "COPY_NOT_AVAILABLE" alert for staff.  The copy will checkout without 
   status warnings.

2. "Available" copies will appear in catalog searches where "limit to
   available" is selected as a search filter.

By default, the "Available" and "Reshelving" statuses have the "Is Available" 
flag set.  The flag may be applied to local/custom statues via the copy
status admin interface.
