New Notice Columns in Items Out Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The grid in the patron "items out" page in the Evergreen web staff client has two new
columns indicating the number of notifications generated for a given loan and the date of
the most recent notification. These columns will allow circulation staff to better respond to
patron questions about whether they were sent notification about an overdue item.

The columns are based on the number of completed Action Trigger events on the
loan that have a 'checkout.due' hook. In other words, they would include overdue
and courtesy notices.

A new library setting, "Exclude Courtesy Notices from Patrons Itemsout Notices Count",
if set will cause the notice count and date fields to exclude courtesy notices.
