Lost Item Billing: New Min/Max Price Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an item is marked lost, the user is typically billed for the item.
In Evergreen, they can either be charged the amount recorded in the item
object, or if that value is blank (or zero), charged a default price
(controlled by settings).

In addition to these existing settings, now we can accommodate a range of
prices by saying the patron should be billed at least 'X' and not more
than 'Y'. This also allows you to effectively set a fixed price for all
lost items by setting min and max to the same amount.
