Support for a Lost and Paid Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature supports a new, optional, _Lost and Paid_ status that can be used
by sites that want to distinguish between lost items with outstanding bills and
those that have been fully paid. A site may want to make this distinction to
set different OPAC visibility or holdability rules for these items.

If enabled, when a lost item is fully paid, the copy's status will automatially
change to _Lost and Paid_.

New setting available via the Library Settings Editor
