Set Per-OU Limits on Allowed Payment Amounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Two new OU Settings have been added to prevent clerks
from accidentally clearing all patron bills by scanning
a barcode into the Payment Amount field, or accidentally
entering the amount without a decimal point (such as you
would when using a cash register).

The first setting is the amount above which staff will
be asked if they're sure they want to apply the payment,
the second is the maximum amount of money that can be
accepted through the staff client.

These settings only effect the staff client, not credit
cards accepted through the OPAC, or direct API calls
from third party tools.
