Set Per-OU Limits on Allowed Payment Amounts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Two new settings have been added to prevent clerks from accidentally clearing
all patron bills by scanning a barcode into the Payment Amount field, or
accidentally entering the amount without a decimal point (such as you
would when using a cash register).

Bothe settings are available via the Library Settings Editor. The _Payment
amount threshold for Are You Sure? dialog_ (ui.circ.billing.amount_warn)
setting identifies the amount above
which staff will be asked if they're sure they want to apply the payment.
The _Maximum payment amount allowed_ (ui.circ.billing.amount_limit)
setting identifies the maximum amount of
money that can be accepted through the staff client.

These settings only effect the staff client, not credit
cards accepted through the OPAC, or direct API calls
from third party tools.
