Option to stop billing activity on zero-balance billed  transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new setting is available via the Library Settings Editor to stop any billing
activity on fully-paid lost or longoverdue transactions. When the _Do not
change fines/fees on zero-balance LOST transaction_ setting is enabled, once a
lost of long overdue transaction
has been fully paid, no more lost fees will be voided or overdue fines restored
or generated if the item is returned. The setting will reduce, though not
eliminate, negative balances in the system.

fines/fees have been completely paid on the transaction, do not void or
reinstate any fines/fees EVEN IF circ.void_lost_on_checkin and/or
circ.void_lost_proc_fee_on_checkin are enabled.
