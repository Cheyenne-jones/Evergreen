Staff Client Honors Aged Circulations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The browser and XUL clients now better represent copy checkout history 
by honoring and displaying information from aged circulations.  

 * Browser client 'Recent Circ History' and the analogous XUL client 
   'Circulation History' tabs show summary data for aged circulations
   as well as regular/active circulations.  When aged circulation data
   is displayed, any references to patron names are replaced by the string
   "<Aged Circulation>".

 * Browser client 'Circ History List' and the analogous XUL client 
   'Last Few Circulations' tabs behave as above, plus their 'Add 
   Billing' buttons are disabled when displaying aged circulation data.

 * XUL client 'Retrieve Last Patron' actions from various UI's report, 
   "Item XXX circulation is an aged circulation and has no linked user".
   Browser client analog uses 'Circ History List' instead, no additional
   changes required.
