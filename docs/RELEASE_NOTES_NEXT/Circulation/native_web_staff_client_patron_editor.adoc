The web staff interface now includes a patron editor/registration form

patron editing.  This feature is currently available in preview mode, but
supports the following actions:

  * adding and editing base patron records and addresses
  * setting statistical categories
  * editing secondary groups
  * cloning patron records
  * duplicate detection
  * surveys
