Alternate Parts Selection Display When Placing Holds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users often miss the list of parts on the Place Holds screen, leading to many
title-level holds on records where only one or two libraries may have
'unparted' copies.

A new option is available to change this display so that a part is selected
via radio buttons instead of the traditional dropdown menu. This display
increases the visibility of parts on the Place Holds screen and also
forces users to make an explicit choice.

To enable the alternate display, set the enable.radio.parts option to 'true'
in parts/config.tt2.
