Patron Preferred Name and Name Search Keywords
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Preferred Name
++++++++++++++

Adds a new set of patron preferred name fields for prefix, first,
middle, last, and suffix allowing patrons to provide preferred name
information.  Preferred names are optional and each acts as an overlay
to the analogous primary name field, making it possible to provide
preferred name values for individual fields.

For example, a patron named William Erickson may have a preferred first
name (pref_first_given_name) of Bill, in which case the preferred name
would be Bill Erickson.  Note a preferred last name is not required in
this case as the code uses primary name values as defaults when not
replaced with a preferred version.

* Patrons will see primary names displayed in the catalog when set.
* Staff will see both primary name and preferred name in the patron
  summary side bar.
* Patron searches for any given name field will search both the primary
  and preferred name data.
* Preferred name fields are available in Action/Trigger templates and
  are present in various patron-focused print templates.

Name Keywords
++++++++++++++

Adds a new field to store miscellaneous patron name search terms.  These
values are only for searching and do not appear in any interfaces, apart
from the patron summary side bar and the patron edit UI.

Included is a new search field in the patron search UI which searches
keyword values and all other name fields.  It's essentially a global patron
name keyword search.
