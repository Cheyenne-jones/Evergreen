EDI order template improvements (no SQL upgrade script!)
========================================================

Improved template for EDI purchase orders.  This theoretically just
works better where the old template worked.  Corrections made for
interactions with ULS, Midwest Tape, Baker & Taylor, and Recorded Books
especially.  GIR segments in the right place.

And also the template is just more maintainable now.

**THERE IS NO UPGRADE SCRIPT INCLUDED**.  Sites using EDI may not
necessarily want to mess with what they already have working.

If you want the changes, and maybe you do, especially if you're doing
enriched ordering and/or ordering from the vendors listed above, you can
extract the template changes easily enough yourself from the
950.data.seed-values.sql file.
