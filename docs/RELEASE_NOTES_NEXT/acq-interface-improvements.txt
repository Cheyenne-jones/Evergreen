Acquisitions Purchase Order and other Interface Improvements
============================================================

Feature Summary
---------------

The following features, which primarily affect the user interface layer,
improve Acquisitions work flows.

  * Avoid double-activation of POs
  * Disable invoice and cancel options for pending POs
  * Disable zero-copy checkbox for activated POs
  * Disable new charges for activated POs
  * Replace "Shelving Location" with Copy Location

  * Rearranging "actions" drop-down
    ** More consitency in actions applying to selected lineitems specifically
    ** Things moved from the per-lineitem dropdown to the main one when
       sensible.
    ** Add to PO dialog added
    ** You can no longer add lineitems to a PO if they're already on one.
    ** Actions in dropdown now enabled/disabled differently depending on
       the interface where it appears (PO vs Selection List vs Acq Search etc.)

  * Batch update for line items
     ** Apply updates to all copies of all selected line items at once
     ** Relies on a middle layer method that streams back information that
        would suit a more asynchronous display in the future (rather than
        simply reloading the page upon success, which it does now)
     ** For failure cases, specific information about which line item cannot
        be updated, and why, is available to the client, although taking
        best advantage of this information for user-friendly display is left
        to the future.
