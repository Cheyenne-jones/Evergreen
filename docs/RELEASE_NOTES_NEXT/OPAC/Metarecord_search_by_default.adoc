Allow Metarecord Search by default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before the TPAC, a site could configure the OPAC to use metarecord searching
by default, via a configuration file.  Here we bring that back.

A new setting called search.metarecord_default is present in
templates/opac/parts/config.tt2 to enable this feature.  By setting this to
a true value (normally 1) the TPAC will silently include the #metabib search
modifier in the search form on any interfaces that do not have a UI component
that allows the user to control the setting.
