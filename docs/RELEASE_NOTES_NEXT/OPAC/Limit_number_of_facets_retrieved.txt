Limit number of facets retrieved during search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Catalog search now sets a limit on the number of facets retrieved
per defined facet field. Setting a limit is useful so that
`open-ils.cstore backends don't end up needlessly consuming
memory when fetching facets for a large result set; if a broad
search retrieves over 10,000 author facets (say), even the most
persistant user is not going to actually look at all of them. Fetching
fewer facets can also slightly speed up generation of search results.

The limit is controlled by a new global flag, `search.max_facets_per_field`,
whose label is "Search: maximum number of facet values to retrieve for
each facet field".  The default limit value is 1,000, but lower values
(e.g., 100) are perhaps even better for most catalogs.
