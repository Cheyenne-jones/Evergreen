New class for searchbar when on the homepage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This adds the `.searchbar-home` class to the div that
contains the searchbar when on the homepage.  This allows
sites to customize the searchbar differently on the
homepage than in other places the
search bar appears (for example, offering a large,
Google-style search bar on the homepage only).
