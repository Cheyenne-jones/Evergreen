E-book integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
OverDrive and OneClickdigital integration has been added to Evergreen. The
system will now support:
 * Display of e-book availability in the search results and record summary
 pages.
 * Display of e-book checkouts and holds in a patron's My Account pages.

To enable this feature, Evergreen sites need to:
  * Ensure the new <http_client> block and open-ils.ebook_api service have been
  added to opensrf.xml and (in the case of the open-ils.ebook_api_service)
  opensrf_core.xml. Both blocks are now included in the example files.
  * Contact their vendor to obtain credentials for their API account.
  * Edit the config.tt2 file to set ebook_api.enabled to true. Administrators
  will also need to enable specific vendor apis and add base URIs that are used
  in 856 fields.
  * Add the credentials for their API account in the new Ebook API Integration
  settings provided in the Library Settings Editor.
