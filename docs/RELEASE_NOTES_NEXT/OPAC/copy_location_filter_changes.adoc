Copy Location Filter Displays for System Searches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Shelving Location filter now displays on the advanced search page when
a search is scoped to a library system, not just to an individual branch. If
a library system is selected as the Search Library, the shelving location
limiter will display any shelving location that is owned by the selected system
or by the consortium. It will NOT display shelving locations owned by child
branches.
