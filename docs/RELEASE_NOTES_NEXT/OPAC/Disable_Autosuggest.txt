Disable Autosuggest by Default
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1187993, the 
community is aware of ongoing accessibility issues caused through use of 
the autosuggest feature of the Evergreen catalog. The decision has been 
made to disable autosuggest by default for new installations. Existing sites
are cautioned to take note of this change and decide for themselves whether
to discontinue use.

It is possible to disable the autosuggest feature by setting the following 
global flag to false and restarting apache. Look in Admin -> Server 
Administration -> Global Flags -> OPAC: Show auto-completing suggestions 
dialog...
