Removal of Advanced Hold Options link when part holds are expected
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If a user attempts to place a metarecord hold when all eligible copies
contain parts, the hold will fail. To help prevent the user from reaching
a dead end while placing holds, the *Advanced Hold Options* link is removed
from the Place Hold page in cases where all copies on the record contain
parts. The *Advanced Hold Options* link will remain for records that have
a mix of parted and non-parted copies.
