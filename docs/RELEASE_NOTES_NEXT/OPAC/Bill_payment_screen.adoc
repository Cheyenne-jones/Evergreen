Improvements to Bill Payment Pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The bill payment pages in the public catalog have been revamped
to

 * use "charges" instead of "fees"
 * include images of credit cards accepted
 * make the print receipt template match other itemized receipts;
   note that this change is not automatically applied when upgrading.
 * display billing type
 * add button to pay just selected charges
 * reformat the page for inputting the credit card number
