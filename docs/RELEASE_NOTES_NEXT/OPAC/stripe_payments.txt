Accepting payments with Stripe
==============================

Stripe is a payment processing service that lets
sites take credit card payments without payment card information ever
touching the sites' own servers.

NOTE: Using Stripe as a payment processor means that clients *must*
have Javascript enabled in order to submit fine payments through your
OPAC.

Library Settings
----------------

The following settings need to be set at the appropriate org level for
sites wanting to use Stripe.

 * "Allow Credit Card Payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.payments.allow

 * "Enable Stripe payments" (should be 'true')

   credit.processor.stripe.enabled

 * "Stripe publishable key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.pubkey

 * "Stripe secret key" (value provided by Stripe)

   credit.processor.stripe.secretkey

 * "Name default credit processor" (should be 'Stripe')

   credit.processor.default
