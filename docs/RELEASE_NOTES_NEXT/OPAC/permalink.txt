Permalinks
^^^^^^^^^^
The record summary page will now offer a link to a shorter permalink that
can be used for sharing the record with others. All URL parameters are stripped
from the link with the exception of the locg and copy_depth parameters. Those
parameters are maintained so that people can share a link that displays just
the holdings from one library/system or displays holdings from all libraries
with a specific library's holdings floating to the top.
