Content Cafe Added Content Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The OpenILS::WWW::AddedContent::ContentCafe provider has been updated to use the
newer Content Cafe 2 API in full. With this update the ability to load content
based on ISBN or UPC is now enabled.


"No Image" Images
+++++++++++++++++
With the updated code the option for displaying a "No Image" image or a 1x1
pixel image is no longer available. Instead the Apache-level "blank image" rules
will trigger when no image is available. The configuration option controlling
this behavior can thus be removed from opensrf.xml entirely.


Identifier Selection
++++++++++++++++++++
By default the module will prefer ISBNs over UPCs, but will request information
for both. If you wish for UPCs to be preferred, or wish one of the two
identifier types to not be considered at all, you can change the
"identifier_order" option in opensrf.xml. When the option is present only the
identifier(s) listed will be sent.
