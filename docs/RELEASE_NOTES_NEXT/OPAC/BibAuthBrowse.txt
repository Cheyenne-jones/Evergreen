Bib record browser with linked authorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature provides a patron-oriented OPAC interface for browsing
bibliographic records.

Users choose to browse by Author, Title, Subject, or Series. They then
enter a browse term, and the nearest match from a left-anchored search
on the headings extracted for browse purposes will be displayed in a
typical backwards/forwards paging display. Headings link to search
results pages showing the related records. If the browse heading is
linked to any authority records, and if any *other* authority records
point to those with "See also" or other non-main entry headings, those
alternative headings are displayed a linked to a search results page
showing related bib records related to the alternate heading.

The counts of holdings displayed next to headings from bibliographic
records are subject to the same visiibility tests as search. This means
that the org unit (and copy location group) dropdown on the browse
interface affects counds, and it further means that whether or not
you're looking at the browse interface through the staff client makes a
difference.

Configuration considerations for site administrators
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There are two off-by-default features that site administrators may wish
to enable.

  * Quick paging links (English): By changing the
    ''browse.english_pager'' setting to 1 in the
    ''opac/parts/config.tt2'' file for a site's active OPAC templates,
    you can make shortcut browsing links ''0-9 A B C D ...'' appear
    between the Back and Forward buttons on the browse page. I haven't
    figured out how to make this feature internationalizable, so it's
    off by default.  You can turn it on if it works for your language,
    or have a look at improving it if it doesn't.

  * There is a global flag by the name
    ''opac.browse.warnable_regexp_per_class'' to control what leading
    articles in users' entered browse terms trigger a warning about how
    it might be better to search for "Rolling Stones" instead of "The
    Rolling Stones" (or whatever). This is off by default, but can be
    enabled if it suits your catalog, and can even be customized per
    search class (author, title, series, subject).
