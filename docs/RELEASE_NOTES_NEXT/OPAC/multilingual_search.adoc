Multi-source Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We now allow record attribute definitions to extract data using more than
one strategy (XPath, tag+subfield, fixed field, etc) as long as the values
from various sources would, after normalization, have the same shape.

Multilingual Search
+++++++++++++++++++
This change allows us to configure multilingual search, by extracting values
from both the 008 controlfield and the 041 datafield.  Because the values
in each can be normalized to the same controlled list (and, in practice, are
already from the same normalized value set), OPAC searches can now use normal
boolean search semantics to find records with various combinations of
language attributes.

Eg., in the concerto test data: keyword: piano item_lang(eng) item_lang(ita)
