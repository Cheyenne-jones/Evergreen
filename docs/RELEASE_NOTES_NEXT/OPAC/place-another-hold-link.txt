Staff option to place another hold on same title
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a hold is successful in the client, staff will now see a link
to place another hold on the same title. This link provides some workflow 
improvement for times when staff are placing holds for multiple patrons on a
newly-added title or when they are placing holds for book clubs.
