RDA Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 * Author fields are now normalized to strip ending periods so that authors from
RDA and non-RDA records are collapsed in browse and facet headings.
 * All author/contrbutor roles will now be displayed in the record detail.
Previously, some of the roles were omitted or were duplicated.

This new feature will require a record reingest.
