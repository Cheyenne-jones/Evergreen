New Color in colors.tt2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Upgrade Notes
+++++++++++++
A new color called _mobile_header_text_ has been added to colors.tt2. Evergreen
sites will need to customize this color so that it fits with their catalog's
color scheme. The color is used to define new search links that will appear in
 _My Account_ screens when viewed on screens smaller than 600px wide. It will
 also be used on any future text that appears in the header area of the catalog.
