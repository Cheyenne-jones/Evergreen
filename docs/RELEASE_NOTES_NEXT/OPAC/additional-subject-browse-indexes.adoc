New Subject Browse Index Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
New subject browse index definitions have been added that display the entire
heading as a unit with hyphens between terms instead of displaying individual
terms separately. 

For example, the browse heading for:

=650 \0$aCats$zUnited States$vCorrespondence.

will display in a single entry as:

Cats -- United States -- Correspondence

Rather than separate entries for Cats and United States. 

Name subjects will continue to display as separate entries because additional
work would be required for the heading to be punctuated correctly.
