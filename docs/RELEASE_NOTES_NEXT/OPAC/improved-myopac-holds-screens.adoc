Improved Holds Screens in My Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The grids in the My Account _Items on Hold_ and _Holds History_ interfaces are
simplified. Data previously contained in their own Activate, Active, and Date
Fulfilled columns are now incorporated into the Status columns. To further
declutter the interface, the holds queue position will only show when the user
most needs the information - before the hold has been captured. 

Distinct CSS classes have also been added for each hold status and each date
that could potentially display in these holds interfaces. A new default style
highlights the _Available_ status in green and the _Suspended_ status
in red.
