Merge Notification Preferences Tables in TPAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The patron notification preference page in the public catalog
used to have two tables, separating notification settings
based on their source. Since that distinction does not matter
to patrons, and since the two tables aren't styled consistently,
they are merged together.
