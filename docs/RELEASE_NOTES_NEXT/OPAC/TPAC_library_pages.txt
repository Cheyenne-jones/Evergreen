= TPAC library pages =

This feature adds one web page per library in the system to the TPAC at
http://hostname/eg/opac/library/<SHORTNAME> and
http://hostname/eg/opac/library/<ID>. The pages publish the following
information from Evergreen (if available):

* Name of the library
* Link to the lbrary web site (from `Library Information URL` library setting)
* Opening hours
* Email address
* Phone number
* Mailing address
* Link to parent library (if applicable)

Library pages are linked from the copy table on the record details page.

== Structured data ==

The library web pages publish schema.org structured data, which can enable
search engines and other systems to better understand your libraries and their
resources.

== Upgrade notes ==

Evergreen 2.5 introduced the `Library information URL` library setting to
associate a web page with a library. If set, this value was used as the target
of the library link in the copy table on the record details page. However, the
new default behavior is to link to the automatically generated TPAC library
page, which in turn links to the external web site.

If you wish to maintain the previous behavior, you can set the `Use external
library information URL` library setting to `True`.
