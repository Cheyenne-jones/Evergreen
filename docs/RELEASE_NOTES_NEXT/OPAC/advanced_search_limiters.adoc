Advanced Search Limiters Enhancement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advanced search limiters will no longer propogate to the basic search box in
the catalog. Instead, the limiters applied to the search will appear in the
left sidebar of the search results screen where they can be easily cleared by
clicking an 'x.' On a small, mobile device, the advanced search limiters can
be seen by clicking an 'x filter applied' link or by clicking the 'Refine
these results' button that typically shows facets to the user.

The selected limiters will be applied to any search from the search bar until:
 * The user actively removes the filters from the search or
 * The user starts a new basic or advanced search from scratch.
