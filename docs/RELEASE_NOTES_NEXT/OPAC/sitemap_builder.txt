Sitemap generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A http://www.sitemaps.org[sitemap] directs search engines to the pages of
interest in a web site so that the search engines can intelligently crawl
your site. In the case of Evergreen, the primary pages of interest are the
bibliographic record detail pages.

The sitemap generator script creates sitemaps that adhere to the
http://sitemaps.org specification, including:

* limiting the number of URLs per sitemap file to no more than 50,000 URLs;
* providing the date that the bibliographic record was last edited, so
  that once a search engine has crawled all of your sites' record detail pages,
  it only has to reindex those pages that are new or have changed since the last
  crawl;
* generating a sitemap index file that points to each of the sitemap files.

Running the sitemap generator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The `sitemap_generator` script must be invoked with the following argument:

* `--lib-hostname`: specifies the hostname for the catalog (for example,
  `--lib-hostname https://catalog.example.com`); all URLs will be generated
  appended to this hostname

Therefore, the following arguments are useful for generating multiple sitemaps
per Evergreen instance:

* `--lib-shortname`: limit the list of record URLs to those which have copies
  owned by the designated library or any of its children;
* `--prefix`: provides a prefix for the sitemap index file names

Other options enable you to override the OpenSRF configuration file and the
database connection credentials, but the default settings are generally fine.

Note that on very large Evergreen instances, sitemaps can consume hundreds of
megabytes of disk space, so ensure that your Evergreen instance has enough room
before running the script.

Scheduling
++++++++++
To enable search engines to maintain a fresh index of your bibliographic
records, you may want to include the script in your cron jobs on a nightly or
weekly basis.

Sitemap files are generated in the same directory from which the script is
invoked, so a cron entry will look something like:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
12 2 * * * cd /openils/var/web && /openils/bin/sitemap_generator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
