Limiter to exclude electronic resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A limiter to exclude electronic resources from search results is now available
on the advanced search screen and from the search results page. This limiter
will exclude any search results with an item form of o or s. This limiter
will be applied on top of any other format limiters used in the search.

The checkboxes are disabled by default; to display them in both places, please
toggle the 'ctx.exclude_electronic_checkbox' setting in config.tt2.
