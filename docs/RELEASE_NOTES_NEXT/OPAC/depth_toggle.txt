Search Scope Depth Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A common usage of the catalog is to do a search in a restricted scope,
like a local library. When the results are lacking, the search is repeated in a
consortium-wide scope.  This feature provides an optional button and checkbox
to alter the depth of the search to a defined level.

This feature can be turned on from config.tt2.
