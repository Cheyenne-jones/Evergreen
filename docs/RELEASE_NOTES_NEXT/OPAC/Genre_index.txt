New Form/Genre Search and Facet Index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The stock indexing definitions now include a search and facet index on the
form/genre field (tag 655). This allows genre links in the public catalog
record display to retrieve works in the same genre. The public catalog genre
links will no longer display content from the 659 MARC fields. 

The genre facet will also display by default in the public catalog.  A partial
reingest during upgrade is required to use this index.
