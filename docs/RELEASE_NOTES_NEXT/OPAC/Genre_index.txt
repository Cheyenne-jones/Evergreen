New Form/Genre Search and Facet Index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The stock indexing definitions now include a search
and facet index on the form/genre field (tag 655)
and a commonly-used local genre field (659).  This allows
genre links in the public catalog record display to retrieve
works in the same genre.  A partial reingest during upgrade
is required to use this index.
