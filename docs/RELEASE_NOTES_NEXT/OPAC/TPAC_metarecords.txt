= TPAC Metarecord Search and Holds =

This feature adds support for searching and placing holds against 
metarecords.

== Metarecord Searching ==

In the top search bar and in the advanced search page, there is a new
search modifier labeled "Group Formats and Editions".  When selected,
searches are performed against metarecords and metarecords are shown
in the results list.

For each metarecord, format icons for all constituent records are shown.
When a use clicks on a metarecord, if the metarecord has multiple
constituent records, the user is taken to the constituent records
list.  Similarly, when a metarecord only has one constituent record,
the user is directed to the record detail page for the constituent
record.

== Metarecord Holds ==

Clicking the place hold link from the metarecord results page shows
the available formats and languages for the metarecord, allowing
the user to limit the scope of the hold.  Non-metarecord holds now
get a new "Advanced Holds Options" link which allows user to promote
a title hold to a metarecord hold, thus providing access 
to the formats / editions selector, before the hold is placed.

In the My Account holds list, icons for all selected formats are 
displayed in the Format columns for the hold.  When editing a 
metarecord hold, users may modify the desired formats and languages.


== Configuration ==

Admins may disable this feature my un-commenting the "metarecord.disabled"
attribute in config.tt2
