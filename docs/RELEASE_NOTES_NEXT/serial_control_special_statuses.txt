Serial Control: Set Special Statuses
====================================
The Serial Control interface prevents direct editing of serial item statuses
for data integrity reasons. As an alternative to direct control, the interface
now offers new menu options for setting items to 'claimed', 'not held', and
'not published'. Note that these statuses are still currently useful for
reporting and display purposes only.
