New report source table allowing report of "last" deleted copy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This source table allows you to construct a clever aggregate report template
which will report bibliographic ID's where a library or a group of libraries 
no longer have a copy attached but had* a copy attached. This is especially
useful when a holdings sync is required with an external vendor.


Instructions for creating the report template:
  * Create a new report template using the "Library Holdings Count with Deleted" as the source
  * Add "Has Only Deleted Copies 0/1" (Min) to the Aggregate Filters -> Change Value to "1"
  * Add "Last Edit Date" (Max) to Aggregate Filters -> Change Operator to "Between"
  * Add Circulation Library -> "Organizational Unit ID" Raw Data to Base Filters -> Change Operator to "In list"
  * Add "Bib ID" to Displayed Fields
  * Add "Last Edit Date" to Displayed Fields and Change Transform to Max
  * Add "Has Only Deleted Copies 0/1" to Displayed Fields and Change Transform to Min
  * Add "Total copies attached" to Displayed Fields and Change Transform to Sum


This template will only output bibliographic ID's where all of the copies for the specified branch(es)
are deleted. Furthermore, it will only output bibs whose copies were edited (deleted) during the 
specified date range. Unfortunatly the user will have to manually type the date range without the date
picker. This view will also allow you to answer questions like "Show me bibs where I have one visible
copy and more than two deleted copies."
