EDI Fetching and Parsing Enhancements / Repairs
===============================================
This release includes various improvements to how Evergreen processes
vendor EDI responses, including order responses and invoices.  Changes
include architectural improvements as well as new features.

Bug Fixes
---------

* Improved order response handling for cancelled items.
* Deleting fund debits (encumbrances) for cancelled items.
* Extracting invoice date
* Invoices include quantity and amount paid (in addition to billed) to reduce
  manual staff data entry
* Proper handling of previously-cancelled (e.g. back-ordered) invoiced items.

Architectural improvements
--------------------------

For EDI parsing, the Ruby libraries, Ruby HTTP gateway, and Business::EDI Perl
modules are no longer needed.  They have been replaced with a single Perl
module which handles EDI parsing.

This reduces the complexity of the fetching and parsing layer.  Though the Ruby
libraries and Ruby HTTP gateway are still needed for outbound EDI (for now), 
the Perl Business::EDI modules are no longer needed at all, so they are no 
longer installed.
