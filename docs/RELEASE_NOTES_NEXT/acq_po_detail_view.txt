Acquisitions Inline Item Detail View
====================================

Acquisitions selection lists and purchase order interfaces contain a new link
beside each lineitem which, when clicked, creates an inline grid of copies
linked to the lineitem.  The grid contains the same information that displays
in the full copy edit grid (from clicking on the Copies(n) link).  However,
the inline grid is read-only, so it displays much faster and does not require
the user to change visual contexts.  

Included along the top of the lineitem table is a new 'âœ“ Expand' link which, 
when clicked, expands or collapses the inline grid for all visible lineitems.
