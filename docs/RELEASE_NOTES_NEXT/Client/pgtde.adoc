Permission Group Display Entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In some cases, it is useful to have the ability to reorder permission, or to make
only specific groups available in the permission group selector for specific
Org Units. An interface has been made available to allow this.

Group Tree Display Entry Interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Permission Group Display Entries can be reordered, added, or removed via
_Administration -> Local Admin -> Permission Tree Display Entries_.
Select the Org Unit you wish to edit the entries in.

Entries may be added using the Add functionality, creating entries based
on permission groups that have not been added to the tree for the Org
Unit you wish to add them to.

Moving an Entry
+++++++++++++++
Moving an entry will shift its position up or down in the patron profile
selector for a given Org Unit.

* Select an entry
* Press either the *Move Up* or *Move Down* button. The entry will be 
moved up or down, accordingly.
* Click *Save* to save your edits.  

NOTE: You may only move up or down entries that have sibling entries.

Removing an Entry
+++++++++++++++++
If you want a particular Org Unit to not have access to specific
entries, you may remove an entry. Removing an entry will remove it from 
view. The entry will remain in the database, marked as disabled.

* Select an entry and press the *Remove* button.

Adding an Entry
+++++++++++++++
You may "add" entries that have been removed previously. This is useful
for moving entries to different parents, or making them root entries.

* If desired, select an entry to be used as the parent entry. 
* Press the *Add* button. 
* Select a permission group from the dropdown.
* If you've selected a parent entry, you may check the *Add Root Entry*
box to override that parent and add the entry on the root level. 
* If you did not select a parent entry, the entry will be added on the root 
level of the tree.
