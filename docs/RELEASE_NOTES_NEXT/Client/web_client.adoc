Trial Production Use of the Web Staff Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The new web staff client is ready for trial production use in all functional
areas with the exception of serials and offline transactions. In addition to
many bug fixes in the areas of circulation, cataloging, administration and
reporting, Release 2.12 sees the following additions to web client
functionality.

 * Acquisitions interfaces and functionality have been integrated into the web
 staff client.
 * Booking interfaces and functionality have been integrated into the web staff
 client.
 * Hatch, the program that will allow for unmediated printing to multiple
 printers, sharing of workstation settings, and, eventually, offline 
 transactions is now available. A windows installer for Hatch will be available
 on the Evergreen-ILS Downloads page.

The Evergreen developers will keep pilot libraries updated about known web
client issues by posting known bugs to https://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:browser_staff:known_issues .

About Hatch
+++++++++++
Hatch is not required to use the web client, but should be used for workstations
that need to perform the following tasks.

 * Unmediated printing to multiple printers. Workstations can print to multiple
 printers without Hatch, but will need to click through a dialog to select a
 printer. Hatch allows workstations to automatically print, without dialog, to
 different printers. 
 * Sharing of workstation settings. When hatch is available for more browsers,
 this functionality will allow sharing across browsers. Libraries may also
 install hatch on a separate computer where the settings can be shared by all
 workstations in the library. Storing local preferences in hatch will also
 prevent tampering with preferences via the browser developer tools.
 * When offline functionality is available, hatch will be required to perform
 offline transactions.
