Accent Insensitive Patron Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When performing a patron search, in addition to the (existing)
case-insensitivity, these additional characteristics will govern the
search:

Accent (diacritic) insensitivity::
Diacritics will be transformed into a plain character equivalent for
comparison purposes. So if the patron name is Eugène Delacroix, for
example, you could enter euge for the First Name, and it would
match. Ligatures such as Œ are expanded into the constituent
characters "OE".

Space insensitivity::
Spaces will be squashed out for comparison purposes. If the patron is,
again, Eugène Delacroix, you could enter "de la croix" in the Last
Name field and it would match.

This behavior affects the Last Name, First Name, and Middle Name fields
of the search.
