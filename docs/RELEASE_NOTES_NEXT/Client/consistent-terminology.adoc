More consistent terminology in the client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Terminology has been updated in the staff client so that we consistently use
the same name to describe the same thing. The following updates have been made:

  * The term 'item' is now consistently used to describe the barcoded entity
that had been previously been called both an 'item' and a 'copy'. As a result,
we now use the terms 'item buckets', 'item tags', and 'item alerts'.
  * The term 'volume' is no longer used in the client, with the exception of
serials, where the term is used to describe serial volumes. The term 'call 
number' will replace volume in most other places.
  *'Holdings' is a more general term used to describe a combination of items
and call numbers.
  * The term 'Shelving Location' is used consistently in favor of 'Copy
Location.'
