Holds Count Column Picker Option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new column picker option showing the number of holds for a given item will
now be available in various interfaces displaying item information, including
the patron's Items Out tab and the Item Status, Check Out, Check In, Renew
Item and Record In-House Use screens.

Note: Because the holds count is generated from the hold_copy_map, newly-added
items and items in a non-holdable status will not display accurate hold counts
until 24 hours after they have been added to the system or moved to a holdable
copy status.
