Disabling of legacy XUL staff client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The legacy XUL staff client is no longer supported in Evergreen
3.2.x and the server-side installation no longer supports a
direct connection by a version XUL client by default.  All
users of Evergreen 3.2.x are strongly urged to complete their
switch to the web staff client as part of upgrading to 3.2.x.

Evergreen administrators who for some reason continue to wish
to deploy the XUL staff client can do so at their risk by
supplying `STAFF_CLIENT_STAMP_ID` during the `make install` step
and using `make_release` to create installers for the staff client.
However, no community support will be provided for the XUL client.
