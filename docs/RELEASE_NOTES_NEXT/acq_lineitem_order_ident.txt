Acquisitions Lineitem Order Identifiers
=======================================

Staff now have the ability to specify the identifier value to use for
lineitems when communicating order information to vendors.  This is 
particularly important when a lineitem has, for example, multiple ISBNs.
Determining which ISBN is to act as the "order identifier" allows staff
to provide the most accurate order information to vendors.  

Supported identifier types include ISBN, ISSN, and UPC.  Order identifier 
values are relayed to vendors via EDI and print PO.

Upgrade Notes
=============

Two new permissions are added for this feature:

 * ACQ_SET_LINEITEM_IDENTIFIER
  ** Allows staff to apply order identifiers to lineitems
 * ACQ_ADD_LINEITEM_IDENTIFIER
  ** Implies that new identifiers shall be added to linked bib records, 
     when a linkage exists.
