MARC Import Tag Stripping
=========================

Administrators can configure MARC tags which are removed from MARC records 
imported via Z39.50 and the Vandelay MARC Import/Export UI (ACQ and non-ACQ).  
Tags are organized into groups.  Groups can be marked as optional or required.
For each tag, every instance of the tag (including all subfields) are removed 
from the record.

MARC fields which are contained within required ('always_apply') tag groups
are always removed from inbound records.  No action is needed.  Tag groups 
which are optional will appear in MARC import interfaces (see below) allowing 
staff to select which groups of tags to strip from incoming records at import 
time.
