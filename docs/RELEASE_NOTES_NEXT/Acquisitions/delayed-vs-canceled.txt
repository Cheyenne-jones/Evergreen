=== Differentiate Delayed vs Canceled Items ===

==== Background ====

Canceled and delayed lineitems and copies in acquisitions are marked as
canceled in the database.  The determining factor of whether an item is
delayed or canceled is the keep_debits flag on the cancel reason.  

The changes below help to differentiate between these two closely related 
states by improving labels in the interface and providing separate counts
for delayed vs. canceled.

==== Changes ====

 * Show number canceled and number delayed in lineitem summary displays
  ** Includes summary displays in invoices and copy grids
 * Update stock cancel cause labels to include "Canceled:.." and 
   "Delayed:..." prefixes.
 * When a lineitem or copy is marked as canceled, show the cancel cause
   label in the interface instead of the bare (and misleading and non-I18N 
   friendly) string "cancelled".
   ** Related, for non-canceled states, show a translatable string 
     representing the name of the state instead of the bare state code.
 * Add cancel cause labels to the print PO and lineitem worksheet templates.

=== Support Cancellation of Delayed Lineitems ===

When a lineitem is marked as delayed (canceled with keep_debits == true), 
allow staff to cancel the lineitem again in the ACQ PO/Picklist interface.
Once a lineitem is marked as truly canceled, it cannot be canceled again.
