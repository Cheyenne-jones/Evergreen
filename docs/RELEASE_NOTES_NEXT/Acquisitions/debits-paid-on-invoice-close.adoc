Disencumber Funds on Invoice Close
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fund debits linked to an invoice are now marked as paid (encumbrance=false)
when the invoice is marked as closed/complete instead of at invoice create
time.  This is particularly useful for EDI invoices which may be 
created well in advance of receipt and payment.
