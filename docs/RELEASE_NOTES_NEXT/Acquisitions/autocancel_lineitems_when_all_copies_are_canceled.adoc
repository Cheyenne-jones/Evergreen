Auto-Cancel Lineitems When All Copies Are Canceled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a copy (lineitem detail) is canceled through the Acquisitions interface, 
the parent lineitem is also canceled if all copies for that lineitem are also 
canceled.  The cancel reason given will come from:

1. The cancel reason for the just-canceled copy if it's a Keep Debits true 
   cancel reason.
2. The cancel reason from any other copy on the lineitem that has a Keep 
   Debits true cancel reason.
3. The cancel reason for the just-canceled copy if no copies have a Keep
   Debits true cancel reason.
