Invoice Closed Date and Closed By Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acquisitions invoices have 2 new fields:

* Close Date -- This is set to the time when the ACQ user clicks the "Close"
  button in the invoice interface.
  ** This field 'replaces' the existing 'complete' field.  An invoice is
     considered complete if a close date value is set.
* Closed By -- This is set to the logged in staff user who performs the 
  "Close" action.

As with the now-defunct 'complete' field, but new fields are cleared in the 
event an invoice is reopened.

These new fields are visible in the invoice interface under the 
'Show Details' action for closed invoices.

Upgrading Invoice Reports
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Existing report templates that reference the invoice 'complete' field 
should be modified to check whether the new close_date field is NOT NULL
instead.

Other Upgrade Considerations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At deploy time, all invoices with a 'complete' value of TRUE will have their
'close_date' field set to NOW.  A value is required, since this field is
now the source of whether an invoice is open or closed.

However, no values will be applied to the closed_by field for already closed
invoices.
