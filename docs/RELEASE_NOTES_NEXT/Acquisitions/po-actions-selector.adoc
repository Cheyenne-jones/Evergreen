PO Actions Selector Always Visible
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The actions selector is now always visible in the purchase order view,
even when no lineitems exist.  With this, users can print PO's that
only contain direct charges.

The custom "Add Brief Record" button is no longer present, since the
same action is accessible via the now-visible selector.
