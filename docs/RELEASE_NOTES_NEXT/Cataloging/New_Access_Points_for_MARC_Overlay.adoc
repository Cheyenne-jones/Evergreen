New Access Points for MARC Merge/Overlay Profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Catalogers can now select a MARC merge/overlay profile to apply when
merging records in the (browser client) record bucket merge and Z39.50
record overlay interfaces. In both interfaces, if the user selects
a merge profile, the results of the merge are displayed, giving the
user the opportunity to choose a different merge profile or edit
the records involved prior to committing to the merge.

A new library setting, "Default Merge Profile (Z39.50 and Record Buckets)",
specifies the merge profile to preselect in the new merge profile
selectors in the record bucket merge and Z39.50 overlay logs. The
selectors will also remember the last selection that the user made.
