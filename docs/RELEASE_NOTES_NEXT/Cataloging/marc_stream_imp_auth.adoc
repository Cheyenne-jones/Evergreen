MARC stream importer authority records and repairs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MARC stream importer script, commonly used with external 
services like OCLC Connexion, is now capable of importing authority
records in addition to bib records.  A single running instance of
the script can import either type of record, based on the record
leader.

New Options
+++++++++++

 * --auth-merge-profile
 * --auth-queue
 * --bib-import-no-match
 * --bib-auto-overlay-exact
 * --bib-auto-overlay-1match
 * --bib-auto-overlay-best-match
 * --auth-import-no-match
 * --auth-auto-overlay-exact
 * --auth-auto-overlay-1match
 * --auth-auto-overlay-best-match

Deprecated Options
++++++++++++++++++

The following options still work and map to the "bib" equivalent
of the option, however a deprecation warning message is generated 
when the script is started.

 * --import-no-match
 * --auto-overlay-exact
 * --auto-overlay-1match
 * --auto-overlay-best-match

No Longer Supported Options
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

--import-by-queue is no longer supported.  This option serves no
particular purpose and is a bad idea when re-using the same queue over
and over as most people do, because queue bloat will increase run times.

--noqueue (AKA "direct import") is no longer supported.  All imports go
through Vandelay now.
