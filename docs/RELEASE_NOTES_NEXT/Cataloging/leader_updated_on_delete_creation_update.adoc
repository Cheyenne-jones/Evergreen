MARC Leader Updated on Bib Deletion, Creation and Update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is now a trigger in place on the bibliographic record table that 
will update the Leader/05 when a new record is inserted, when a record 
is updated or deleted.  On insert (created new or imported) it will be 
marked as 'n' for new, on update (including undeletion) it will be 
marked 'c' for modified and on deletion will be marked 'd' for deleted.
