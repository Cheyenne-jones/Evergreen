Additional Fixed Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The AccM, Comp, CrTp, EntW, Cont, FMus, LTxt, Orig, Part, Proj, Relf, SpFm,
SrTp, Tech, and TrAr fixed fields have been defined and coded value maps added
so they can also be used for Advanced Searches or adding to Composite Value Maps.

Note that AccM, Cont, LTxt, Relf, and SpFm are  compositite values based on
the values of "helper" fields like AccM(1), AccM(2), and so on. These positional
fields can be ignored.

Coded value maps have also been added for Cont, Ctry, and DtSt, and the Time field
has been defined. All of these fields are now available in the Fixed Field Editor
when editing the appropriate records.
