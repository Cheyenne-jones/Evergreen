TPAC Copy View/Edit Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adds 'view' and 'edit' links next to each copy in the TPAC record
details copy grid when viewed from within the staff client.  The 'edit'
link only appears when the authenticated user has permission to edit the
specified copy.

Both links open new tabs.  When the 'edit' link used, the 'Unified
Volume/Item Creator/Editor' org unit setting is inspected to determine
which style of copy edit interface to display.
