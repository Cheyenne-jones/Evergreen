= Enhancements to Evergreen's MARC Editor Concerning Fixed Fields =


This work is a combination of two features. One provides suggested
values in a right-click context menus for fixed field values based on
the 'type' of the record being edited. The other provides a wizard to
help specifically with the Physical Characteristics of the record, i.e.
the 007 field.

== Right-Click Context Menus ==

Users will be able to right-click on the value control for fixed fields
in the MARC Editor, and Evergreen will provide a menu from which the
user can select a possible value. This will work for fixed fields where
Evergreen already contains information from the Library of Congress's
MARC 21 standard.

Example:

Evergreen already comes loaded with information from the Library of
Congress's MARC 21 standard on possible values for some fixed fields.

The following table shows which fixed fields for which 'Record Types'
have values already loaded into Evergreen.

---------------------------------------------------------

 Fixed Field |          Record Types
-------------+-----------------------------------
 Audn        | {BKS,COM,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 BLvl        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 Form        | {BKS,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 Lang        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}
 LitF        | {BKS}
 Type        | {BKS,COM,MAP,MIX,REC,SCO,SER,VIS}


---------------------------------------------------------

A 'Record Type' is itself a combination of the 'Type of Record' (fixed
field name: Type) and 'Bibliographic Level' (fixed field name: BLvl)
elements of the MARC leader (positions 06 and 07 respectively). You can
see a record's Record Type in the MARC Editor as shown in
this screenshot:

'Record Type':

A user may add values to these fixed fields as well as to other fixed
fields through the MARC Coded Value Maps interface found under the Admin
-> Server Administration menu in the staff client. These are grouped by
Record Attribute Types (a superset of fixed fields) which have labels
such as 'Alph', 'Biog', 'Videorecording format', and 'Language'.

From LOC Fixed Fields documentation, 'Alph' is 'Original alphabet or
script of title', 'Biog' is 'Biography', 'Videorecording format' is from
the 007 field, 'Language' is positions 35-37 of the 008, and so on.
Other Record Attribute Types such as 'Author' are, of course, not fixed
fields at all.

When users add new values here, the right-click context menus of the
fixed fields in the MARC Editor will include those values.

All values added for any fixed field in the Coded Value Map will display
for any 'Record Type' that uses that fixed field.

Users of the MARC Editor always retain the option of leaving a fixed
field blank, entering the special values # or |, or entering a value not
provided by the right-click context menu.

== Physical Characteristics Wizard ==

By right-clicking on an existing or new 007 field in the MARC Editor, users
will be able to enter a wizard that leads them step-by-step through the
positions in that 007 field, telling them the significance of the current
position and providing a drop-down list of possible values.
