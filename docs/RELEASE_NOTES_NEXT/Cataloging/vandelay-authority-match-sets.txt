==== Vandelay Authority Record Match Sets ====

Vandelay MARC Batch Import/Export now supports match sets for authority
record import matching.  Matches can be made against MARC tag/subfield
entries and against a record's normalized heading + thesaurus.  Internal
identifier (901c) matches are also supported.

===== UI Modifications =====

 * Authority matches display the normalized heading/thesuarus for each 
   match.
 * Item import summary is not displayed for authority queues, since
   items cannot be imported with authority records.
