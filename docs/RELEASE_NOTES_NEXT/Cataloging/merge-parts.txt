Monograph Part Merging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The monograph part list for a bibliographic record may, over time, diverge from the
proscribed format, resulting in multiple labels for what are essentially the same
item.  For instance, ``++Vol.{nbsp}1++'' may have variants like ``++V.1++'', ``++Vol{nbsp}1++'', or ``++{nbsp}Vol.{nbsp}1++'' (leading space).
This feature will allow catalog staff to collapse the variants into one value.

In the Monograph Parts display:

. Click the checkbox for all items you wish to merge including the one you wish to prevail when done.
. Click on the ``Merge Selected'' button. A pop-up window will list the selected items in
a monospaced font, with blanks represented by a middle-dot character for more visibility.
. Click on the item you wish to prevail.

The undesired part labels will be deleted, and any copies that previously used those labels will 
now use the prevailing label.
