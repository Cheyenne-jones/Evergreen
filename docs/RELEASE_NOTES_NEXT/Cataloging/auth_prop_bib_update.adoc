Authority Propagation Updates Bib Editor / Edit Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a bib record is automatically updated as a result of the
modification of a linked authority record, the bib record's "Last Edit
Data/Time" and "Last Editing User" fields will be updated to match the
time of the update and the editor of the modified authority record.

A new global flag is available to control this behavior called
'ingest.disable_authority_auto_update_bib_meta' ("Authority Automation:
Disable automatic authority updates from modifying bib record editor
and edit_date").  When enabled, theses fields will not be updated.  By
default, this setting is disabled.

An additional speed improvement is included in this feature.  No attempt
will be made to update linked bib records when the normalized heading of
the modified authority record is unchanged by the authority record update.
