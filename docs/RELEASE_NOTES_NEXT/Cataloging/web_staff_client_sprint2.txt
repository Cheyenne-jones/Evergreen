Web staff client cataloging preview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The web staff client now includes additional functionality
to support cataloging and item maintenance, including:

- a new MARC editor
- the service backing the authority headings chooser now
  has the ability to filter the browse by subject thesaurus
- Z39.50 search and record import
- improvements to copy and record bucket functionality
- embedding the link checker interface
- embedding the MARC batch import/export interface
- the web staff volume/copy editor

Nearly all of the cataloging functionality available in the XUL
staff client is now present in the web staff client with the 
exception of printing spine labels. Nonetheless, the web staff
client remains a preview and is not recommended for production use.
