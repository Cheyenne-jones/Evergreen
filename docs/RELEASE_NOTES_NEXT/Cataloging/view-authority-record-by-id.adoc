View Authority Record by Database ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new interface allows catalogers to retrieve a specific
authority record using its database ID.  Catalogers can
find those IDs in subfield $0 of matching fields in
bibliographic records.

To use the new authority record viewer:

. Click *Cataloging -> Retrieve Authority Record by ID*.
. Type in the ID number of the authority record you are
interested in. Don't include any prefixes, just the ID
number.
. Click *Submit*.
. View or edit the authority record as needed.
