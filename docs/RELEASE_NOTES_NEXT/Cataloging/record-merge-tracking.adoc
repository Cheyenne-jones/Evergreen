Track Record Merges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When 2 or more bib records are merged, all records involved are stamped
with a new merge_date value.  For any bib record, this field indicates
the last time it was involved in a merge.  At the same time, all
subordinate records (i.e. those deleted as a product of the merge) are
stamped with a merged_to value indicating which bib reord the source
record was merged with.

In the browser client bib record display, a warning alert now appears
along the top of the page (below the Deleted alert) indicating when a
record was used in a merge, when it was merged, and which record it was
merge with, rendered as a link to the target record.
