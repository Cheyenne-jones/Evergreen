Display "Imported As" in Vandelay Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This simple new feature appears within the Cataloging *MARC Batch 
Import/Export* screens. When viewing the contents of a Vandelay queue, 
for example when inspecting a queue or right after bib imports, there is 
a new column displayed called _Imported As_. This new column displays the 
record ID, also known as the bib number, of the bib records currently 
listed in the queue. If the bib records listed in the queue have not been 
imported yet, this column is blank until the queued records are imported. 
After import the queued records will display the assigned record ID for 
the listed bib(s).
