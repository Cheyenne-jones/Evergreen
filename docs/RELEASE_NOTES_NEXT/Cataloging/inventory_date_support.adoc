Support for Last Inventory Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Evergreen now provides an option to add an inventory date to items to facilitate
the process of performing inventory in libraries. Staff can add an inventory
date to an item in one of the following ways:
 * From the check in screen, there is now an Update Inventory check in modifier.
When selected, scanned barcodes will have the current date/time added as the
inventory date while the item is checked in.
 * From the Item Status screen, an action is available to add the current 
date/time as the inventory date to selected items.

This new feature will also store the workstation that was used when the
inventory date was updated.
