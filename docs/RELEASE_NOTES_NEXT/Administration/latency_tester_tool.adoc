New Latency Tester Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Evergreen Web Staff Client now includes link to a section under the
Administration > Workstation called Tests. This page houses a simple tool
that can be used to test the latency of the websocket connection between the 
client and the server (via the opensrf.echo service).

This page displays which Evergreen host server is being queried. Upon hitting
the blue "Start Test" button for the first time, it will issue 10 sequentially
fired requests in order to get a solid initial average. Clicking the button a
second time will just take one more measurement and recalculate the average
latency. The results can be copied to clipboard for troubleshooting purposes
and also cleared from display.
