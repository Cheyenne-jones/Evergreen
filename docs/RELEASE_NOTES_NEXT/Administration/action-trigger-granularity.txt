==== Upgrade Notes ====

The 'granularity' field in the staff client Action Trigger Event
Definition configuration interface (Admin -> Local Administration ->
Notifications / Action Triggers) is now case sensitive.  Previously,
entering, for example, 'hourly' would be automatically modified to
'Hourly'.  Now, 'hourly' and 'Hourly' are each valid, distinct values,
and the form field now always provides the lowercase value.

This is important because the granularity values configured on the
server for processing action/trigger events are case sensitive as
well. When upgrading, please check that your saved values match the
values used in your crontab.
