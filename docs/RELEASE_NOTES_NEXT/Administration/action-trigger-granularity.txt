==== Upgrade Notes ====

The 'granularity' field in the staff client Action Trigger Event
Definition configuration interface (Admin -> Local Administration ->
Notifications / Action Triggers) is now case sensitive.  Previously,
entering, for example, 'hourly' would be automatically modified to
'Hourly'.  Now, 'hourly' and 'Hourly' are each valid, distinct values.

This is important because the granularitiy values configured on the
server for processing action/trigger events are case sensitive as
well.
