New Patron Action Trigger Notice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new Action Trigger event definition ("New User Created Welcome Notice") 
has been added that will allow you to send a notice after a new patron has 
been created, based on the actor.usr create-date field.

This notice can be used for various tasks.

  * Sending a welcome email to new patrons to market Library services.
  * Confirm that a new patron email address is correct.
  * Generate postal notices to send a welcome packet to new patrons.

Enable this event in the staff client at *Admin* -> *Local Administration* 
-> *Notifications / Action Triggers*.
