Set resource limits for Clark Kent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Several parameters are now available for the reporter daemon process
(`clark-kent.pl`) to control resource usage.  These can be used to
reduce the chances that a malformed report can cause indigestion
on a database or reports server.  The new parameters, which can be
set in `opensrf.xml` or as command-line switches for `clark-kent.pl` are

* `//reporter/setup/statement_timeout` / `--statement-timeout`

Number of minutes to allow a report's underlying SQL query
to run before it gets cancelled.  Default value is
60 minutes.  If a report's query gets cancelled, the
error_text value will be set to a valid that indicates that
the allowed time was exceeded.

* `//reporter/setup/max_rows_for_charts` / `--max-rows-for-charts`

Number of rows permitted in the query's output before
Clark Kent refuses to attempt to draw a graph. Default
value is 1,000 rows.

* `//reporter/setup/resultset_limit` / `--resultset-limit`

If set, truncates the report's output to the specified
number of hits.  Note that it will not be apparent
to a staff user if the report's output has been
truncated.  Default value is unlimited.

The report concurrency (i.e., the number of reports that Clark
Kent will run in parallel) can now also be controlled via
the `opensrf.xml` setting `//reporter/setup/parallel`.
