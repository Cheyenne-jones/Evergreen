Removed unused selfcheck password setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There was an unused duplicate selfcheck password setting that was removed
to avoid confusion over which library setting was supposed to be set to
enable passwords for selfcheck. After upgrading, verify that your library
policy remains consistent for this setting.
