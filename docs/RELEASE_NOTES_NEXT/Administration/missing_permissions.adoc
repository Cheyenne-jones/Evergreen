Addition of missing permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Required permissions that were previously missing from the stock data have now
been added. If Evergreen sites have already manually added these permissions,
the upgrade script will remove the old permission and create the new one,
maintaining any maps to permission groups, with the stock permission ID.
