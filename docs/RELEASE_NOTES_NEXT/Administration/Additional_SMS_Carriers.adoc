Additional SMS Carriers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SMS carrier definitions are now included for Google Fi and
Republic Wireless. These will be automatically loaded when
installing a new Evergreen system; admins who wish to
add these definitions during an upgrade can use the following
email gateway values:

 * Google Fi: `$number@msg.fi.google.com`
 * Republic Wireless: `$number@text.republicwireless.com`
