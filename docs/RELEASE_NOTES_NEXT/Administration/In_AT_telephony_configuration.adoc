Configure multiple telephony servers via Action/Trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are using the AstCall Action/Trigger reactor
to generate callfiles to send to an Asterisk server, until
now the only place to specify the relevant configuration
was in `opensrf.xml`. However, this restricted an Evergreen
consortium to using only one Asterisk instance.

Now, the telephony parameters can also be specified as 
A/T event parameters, allowing per-library configuration.
