Remove JSPAC Redirects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Future versions of Evergreen will no longer contain automatic redirects 
from JSPAC URLs to TPAC URLs, given that the JSPAC is no longer supported.
Existing sites, however, may wish to retain JSPAC redirects in their 
Apache configuration files since JSPAC URLs may still be used in the wild 
to access their catalogs.
