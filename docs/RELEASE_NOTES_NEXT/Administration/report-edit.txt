==== Report Editing ====

Users may now view and edit existing reports.

With each report in the Reports folder view there are two new links,
one for viewing (read-only) and one for editing.  After changing a 
report, the user has the option to save the modified report
or create a new report with the new values, in effect cloning
the original report.

When saving a changed report, if a pending report run exists, the user
will be warned of this and asked if they would prefer to modify the
scheduled report or to instead save the changed values as a new 
report, leaving the original report intact.
