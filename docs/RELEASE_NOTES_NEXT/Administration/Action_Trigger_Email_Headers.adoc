Add Date Header to Action Trigger Email/SMS Templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Date: header specified in RFC 2822 has been added to the seed data
for the example Action Trigger email and SMS templates, but no attempt
has been made to automatically modify existing templates. To add this
header (and end any "Why are my library emails from 1969/70?" questions
you may have heard) make sure the following lines are in all templates
that use the SendEmail or SendSMS reactors:

The first is already in most sample templates, but you may need to add
it to the top of any custom templates:
`[%- USE date -%]`

And this line should be inserted into the header block of each template:
`Date: [%- date.format(date.now, '%a, %d %b %Y %T -0000', gmt => 1) %]`
