Improved caching of web server templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Template Toolkit processors used by Apache are now cached for
better performance (by virtue of thereby being able to take advantage
of Template Toolkit's internal caching mechanism). In addition, the
*compiled* versions of the templates themselves can be cached to
provide an additional performance boost.

Two Apache virtualhost configuration variables are added to
control caching of compiled templates:

 * `OILSWebCompiledTemplateCache` - specifies location on the
   web server filesystem to store compiled templates.
 * `OILSWebTemplateStatTTL` - specifies number of seconds before
   checking to see if a newer version of a cached template is
   available.

As a result of the caching changes, it is now necessary for
Evergreen administrators to reload Apache to ensure that a change
to (say) TPAC templates becomes visible.
