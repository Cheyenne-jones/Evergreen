New EDI Order Generator 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration
+++++++++++++

. New database tables exist for configuring vendor-specific EDI order 
attributes.

 * acq.edi_attr 
  ** List of EDI order generation toggles, e.g. "INCLUDE_COPIES" to add 
     GIR segments
 * acq.edi_attr_set
  ** Collection of edi_attr's.  Each edi_account may be linked to one
     edi_attr_set.
  ** One edi_attr_set per known vendor is added to the stock data, matching
     the stock configuration found in the JEDI template.
 * acq.edi_attr_set_map
  ** Link between edi_attr's and edi_attr_set's.

. EDI Attribute Sets are manged via a new (browser client only) configuration
  interface at Administration -> Acquisistions Administration -> EDI
  Attribute Sets.

. Each acq.edi_account should be linked to an acq.edi_attr_set.  If a link 
  is not set, default values will be used.  Links between an EDI account
  and an attribute set are managed in the EDI Accounts configuration 
  interface.

. Local modifications to the stock EG JEDI template are managed by modifying
  and/or adding additional edi_att_set's as needed.

. A new edi_order_pusher.pl script is added which replaces the functionality
  of edi_pusher.pl.  edi_pusher.pl is still avaialable.

. After moving to edi_order_pusher.pl, the JEDI Action/Trigger event
  definition is no longer required.  It can be disabled.

Migration
+++++++++

EDI accounts have a new boolean field "Use EDI Attributes" (use_attrs) that 
specifies whether PO's generated via the account should be built using 
EDI attributes or fall back to traditional JEDI A/T template generation.

This allows sites to activate EDI attributes on a per-account basis, making 
it possible to migrate piecemeal to EDI attributes.  For the initial roll
out of this new features, no accounts will be configured to use EDI 
attributes by default.
