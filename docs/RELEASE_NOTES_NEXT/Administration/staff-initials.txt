Add granular settings for requiring staff initials for notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are now three separate library settings for controlling whether staff 
are required to input their initials when creating different types of notes.
See new library settings below.

Any pre-existing library setting for requiring staff initials are preserved 
during the upgrade process. After upgrading, you may choose to change the set
behavior for any of the three new settings.
