Switch to XLSX format for Excel report output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With previous versions of Evergreen, reports generated in the Excel output
were limited to a maximum of 64,000 rows.  This was a limitation due to the 
Excel format ".xls". Now, new report outputs for Excel will use format ".xlsx"
which allows for much larger report output rows.
