Bibliographic Fingerprint Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The bibliographic fingerprint will now incorporate subfield n and p from MARC
title fields to better distinguish between records of the same series that
may share the same title but have a different part. With this change, these
MARC records will no longer be grouped together in a 'Group Formats & Editions'
search.

The bibliographic fingerprint was also changed to better distinguish between a
the fields contributing to the fingerprint. This change will help the system
distinguish between a record for the movie _Blue Steel_ and another record for
the book _Blue_ written by Danielle Steel.
