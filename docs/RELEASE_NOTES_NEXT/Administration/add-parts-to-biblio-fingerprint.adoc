Bibliographic Fingerprint Improvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The bibliographic fingerprint will now incorporate subfield n and p from MARC
title fields to better distinguish between records of the same series that
may share the same title but have a different part. With this change, these
MARC records will no longer be grouped together in a 'Group Formats & Editions'
search.
