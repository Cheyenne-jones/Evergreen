New TPAC config option: Show more details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a new option for TPAC to show more details by default.

The Option for full details as a default, which may be especially important
for e-content.  Valid values are 'true', 'false' and 'hide'.

Setting this to 'true' shows full details by default but allows the link
to appear for 'Show Fewer Details'. The 'hide' option shows full details
and also suppresses the link from displaying at all.

Look for "show_more_details.default" in config.tt2.
