marc_export --uris option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The marc_export support script now has a --uris option (short form:
-u) to export records with located URIs.  When used by itself, it will
export only records that have located URIs.  When used in conjunction
with --items, it will add records with located URIs but no
items/copies to the output.  If combined with a --library or
--descendants option, this option will limit its output to those
records with URIs at the designated libraries.  The best way to use
this option is in combination with the --items and one of the
--library or --descendants options to export *all* of a library's
holdings both real and electronic.
