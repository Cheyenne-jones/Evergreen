Deleted flag for copy locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A deleted flag is now available for copy locations, allowing them to be
"deleted" without losing statistical information for circulations in a given
copy location. It also allows copy locations that are only used by deleted
items to be deleted.

When a copy location is deleted, it will remain in the database, but will be
removed from display in the staff client and the catalog.
