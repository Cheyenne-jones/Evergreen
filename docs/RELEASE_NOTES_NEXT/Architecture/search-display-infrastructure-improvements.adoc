Virtual Index Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The practical purpose of Virtual Index Definitions is to supply an Evergreen
administrator with the ability to control the weighting and field inclusion of
values in the general keyword index, commonly referred to as "the blob,"
without requiring tricky configuration that has subtle semantics, an
over-abundance of index definitions which can slow search generally, or the
need to reingest all records on a regular basis as experiments are performed
and the configuration refined. Significant results of recasting keyword indexes
as a set of one or more Virtual Index Definitions will be simpler search
configuration management, faster search speed overall, and more practical
reconfiguration and adjustment as needed.

Previous to this commit, in order to provide field-specific weighting to
keyword matches against titles or authors, an administrator must duplicate many
other index definitions and supply overriding weights to those duplicates. This
not only complicates configuration, but slows down record ingest as well as
search. It is also fairly ineffective at achieving the goal of weighted keyword
fields. Virtual Index Definitions will substantially alleviate the need for
these workarounds and their consequences.

  * A Virtual Index Definition does not require any configuration for
extracting bibliographic data from records, but instead can become a sink for
data collected by other index definitions, which is then colocated together to
supply a search target made up of the separately extracted data. Virtual Index
Definitions are effectively treated as aggregate definitions, matching across
all values extracted from constituent non-virtual index definitions.  They can
further make use of the Combined class functionality to colocate all values in a
class together for matching even across virtual fields.

  * Configuration allows for weighting of constituent index definitions that
participate in a Virtual Index Definition. This weighting is separate from the
weighting supplied when the index definition itself is a search target.

  * The Evergreen QueryParser driver returns the list of fields actually
searched using every user-supplied term set, including constituent expansion
when a Virtual Index Definition is searched. In particular, this will facilitate
Search Term Highlighting described below.

  * Stock configuration changes make use of pre-existing, non-virtual index
definitions mapped to new a Virtual Index Definition that implements the
functionality provided by the keyword|keyword index definition. The
keyword|keyword definition is left in place for the time being, until more data
can be gathered about the real-world effect of removing it entirely and 
replacing it with Virtual Index Definition mappings.

  * New system administration functions will be created to facilitate
modification of Virtual Index Definition mapping, avoiding the need for a full
reingest when existing index definitions are added or removed from a virtual
field.

Increased use of Metabib Display Fields
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
We use Metabib Display Fields (newly available in 3.0) to render catalog search
results, intermediate metarecord results, and record detail pages.This requires
the addition of several new Metabib Display Field definitions, as well as Perl
services to gather and render the data.

We also use more Metabib Display Fields in the client. As a result, 
bibliographic fields will display in proper case in more client interfaces and
in Evergreen reports.

Search Term Highlighting
++++++++++++++++++++++++
This commit enables Search Term Highlighting in the OPAC on the main search
results page, the record detail page, and intermediate pages such as metarecord
grouped results page. Highlighting search terms will help the user determine why
a particular record (or set of records) was retrieved.

Highlighting of matched terms uses the same stemming used to accomplish the
search, as configured per field and class.

This feature will help the user more quickly determine the relevance of a
particular record by calling their attention to search terms in context. Lastly,
it will help familiarize the user with how records are searched, including which
fields are searched as well as exposing concepts like stemming.

Interfaces
++++++++++
A new AngularJS "MARC Search/Facet Fields" interface has been created to replace
the Dojo version, and both have been extended to support Virtual Index
Definition data supplier mapping and weighting.

Settings & Permissions
++++++++++++++++++++++
The new Virtual Index Definition data supplier mapping table, 
config.metabib_field_virtual_map, requires the same permissions as the
MARC Search/Facet Fields interface: CREATE_METABIB_FIELD, UPDATE_METABIB_FIELD,
DELETE_METABIB_FIELD, or ADMIN_METABIB_FIELD for all actions

There is a new template-level global configuration variable in config.tt2 called
search.no_highlight which disables highlighting for users of that config.tt2
instance.

Public Catalog
++++++++++++++
The public and staff catalog will make use of new APIs to identify and display
highlight-augmented values for those Display Fields used to render the search
result pages, intermediate metarecord constituent pages, and record detail
pages.  Highlighting of terms will be performed using the application of
Template::Toolkit-driven CSS. A generic CSS class identifying a highlighted
term, along with CSS classes identifying the search class and each search field
will be available for use for customization of the highlighting. A stock CSS
template is provided as a baseline upon which sites may expand.

When highlighting is generally enabled, it may be turned on or off on a per-page
basis through the use of a UI component which will request the page again
without highlighting.

Backend
+++++++
There now exist several new database tables and functions primarily in support
of search highlighting. Additionally, the QueryParser driver for Evergreen has
been augmented to be able to return a data structure describing how the search
was performed, in a way that allows a separate support API to gather a
highlighted version of the Display Field data for a given record.

Default Weights
+++++++++++++++
By default, the following fields will be weighted more heavily in keyword 
searches. Administrators can change these defaults by changing the values in the
 "All searchable fields" virtual index in the "MARC Search/Facet Fields"
interface.

  * Title proper
  * Main title (a new index limited to the words in the 245a)
  * Personal author
  * All subjects

In addition, note indexes and the physical description index will receive
less weight in default keyword searches.


Re-ingest or Indexing Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
With the addition and modification of many Index Definitions, a full reingest is
recommended.  However, search will continue to work as it did before the changes
in this commit for those records that have not yet been reingested during that
process.  Therefore a slow, rolling reingest is recommended.

Performance Implications or Concerns
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Because the Metabib Display Fields infrastructure will eventually replace
functionality that is significantly more CPU-intensive in the various forms of
XML parsing, XSLT transformation, XPath calculation, and
Metabib Virtual Record construction, it is expected that the overall CPU load
will be reduced by this development, and ideally the overall time required to
perform and render a search will likewise drop. It is unlikely that the speed 
increase will be visible to users on a per-search basis, but that search in
aggregate will become a smaller consumer of resources.
