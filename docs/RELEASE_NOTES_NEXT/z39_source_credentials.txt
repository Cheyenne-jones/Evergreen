Storing Z39.50 Server Credentials
=================================

In the Z39.50 configuration interface, staff now have the option to apply
z39.50 login credentials to each Z39.50 server at different levels of the 
org unit hierarchy (similar to org unit settings).  When credentials are set 
for a Z39 server, searches against the z39 server will used the stored 
credentials, unless other credentials are provided by the caller, in which 
case the caller credentials are used.

For security purposes, passwords may not be retrieved or reported on by staff.  
Staff can only apply new values for credentials or clear existing ones.
