ACQ Invoice Inline Lineitem Search and Add
------------------------------------------

The Invoice UI is how composed of two tabs, the main invoice tab and a new Search tab.  The search tab consists of a subset of the Acquisitions unified search interface.  The goal is to allow users to search for lineitems to invoice.  Search results may be added directly to the growing invoice.  A number of small usability features are included.

Features
~~~~~~~~

    * Option (default) to limit searches to invoiceable items.  
        ** These are lineitems that are not cancelled, have at least one invoiceable copy, linked to a PO whose provider matches that of the current invoice, and are not already linked to the current invoice.
    * Search defaults to last-run search (on workstation).
    * New Lineitem Detail filter options
    * Sort searches by lineitem number (default) and title.
    * There is a new Expected Cost field which includes both the total invoiced cost plus the anticipated cost of lineitems as they are added.
    * New Price per Copy field
    * Lineitem count field
    * Show / Hide Invoice details button.  Details are displayed by default, but hidden when the user enters the search tab.  From there it remains hidden until manually shown (or a new invoice is opened).
    * A new "Save & Clear" button which saves the current invoice then clears the invoice display to create a new invoice.
    * Provider, shipper, and receiver fields are auto-populated from the first-added invoice data (when not already set).
    * Totals are now read-only, since they are derived from existing data (and are informational only).
