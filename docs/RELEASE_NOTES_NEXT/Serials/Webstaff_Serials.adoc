Web Staff Client Serials Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The serials module has been ported over to the web staff
client, implementing a unified serials interface that combines
ideas from both the serial control view and alternate serials
control view from the old staff client.

In addition to carrying over functionality that was available
in the old staff client, several new features are included:

* the ability to save prediction pattern codes as templates
  that can be shared and reused within an Evergreen database
* a more streamlined interface for managing subscriptions,
  distributions, and streams
* it is no longer necessary to create a starting issue in
  order to predict a run of issues; the dialog box for
  generating a set of predicted issues now lets you specify
  the starting point directly.
* the ability to more directly edit MFHDs
    
The new serials interfaces can be accessed from the record
details page via a Serials drop-down button that links to
a subscription management page, a quick-receive action, and
a MFHD management page. There is also a new Serials Administration
page where prediction pattern and serial copy templates can
be managed.
