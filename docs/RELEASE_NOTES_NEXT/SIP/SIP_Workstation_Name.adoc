Treat SIP Location Field as Login Workstation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When using a version of SIPServer that supports the feature,
the Location (CP) field of the Login (93) message will be
used as the workstation name if supplied. Blank or missing
location fields will be ignored. This allows users or reports
to determine which selfcheck performed a circulation.
