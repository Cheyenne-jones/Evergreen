EDI Invoices
============

The same setup that is required today for retrieving and reacting to EDI Order
Response messages (ORDRSP) will also react to Invoices (INVOIC).

This essentially means you must have a Provider (acq.provider) configured with
an EDI Account (acq.edi_account) containing login credentials for a vendor, you must have the edi_webrick service running (EDI translator), and you must have
the edi_pusher script run periodically by cron.

An open Evergreen invoice will be created for a each EDI Invoice message.
Evergreen invoice entries will be created for each lineitem detected in the
EDI message if that lineitem can be linked to a known Evergreen lineitem in
your system.  An Evergreen invoice item will be created for a whole-invoice
tax.
