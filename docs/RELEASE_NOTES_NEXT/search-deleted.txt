Searching for deleted records
=============================

Evergreen now supports searching for deleted records via the '#deleted'
QP modifier.

In order to support this, sites must enable the
'ingest.metarecord_mapping.preserve_on_delete' internal flag.  It is off by
default since the ability to search for deleted records requires keeping
metarecord mappings around when bibs are deleted, which may not be desirable
for the typical site.
