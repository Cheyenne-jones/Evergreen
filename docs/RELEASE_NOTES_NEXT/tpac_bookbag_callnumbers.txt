New Feature: Show local call number in TPAC My Lists display
============================================================

If an opac-visible call number exists that is owned by an org unit
relevant to the patron, show the most relevant call number label
and owning branch name in the My Lists display for each record in
the list.  Call number is displayed in both saved and temporary lists.

A call number is considered relevant if its owner is one of:

physical location library
preferred library (plib, home, etc.)
search library

If no relevant call number is found, no call number is diplayed.
