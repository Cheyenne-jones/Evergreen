Evergreen 2.1 release notes
===========================

Installation enhancements:
--------------------------
* `eg_db_config.pl` now has a `--create-database` option to automatically create
  the database and add the required contrib modules/extensions, rather than
  requiring users to carry out a number of error-prone manual steps.
* README is now the single source of install instructions

Administration enhancements:
----------------------------
* Automatic client updates: It is now possible to build staff clients that,
  when they connect to the Evergreen server, automatically check to see if
  the staff client has been updated. If so, the staff client can download just
  the files that have been updated and replace those files in the existing
  staff client.
* Printing subsystem: Changes to the staff client should improve the print
  functionality (both speed and likelihood of success).
* To protect against exploits between a shared staff client session via
  operator change, add the requirement for the DEBUG_CLIENT permission to
  invoke debugging functions such as the Javascript Shell or DOM Inspector
   in the staff client.

Cataloging enhancements:
------------------------
* Unified copy / call number editor: The default holdings maintenance interface
  now enables cataloguers to edit copies and call numbers on a single screen.
* Call number prefixes and suffixes: While previous releases of Evergreen
  supported the automatic prepending or appending of prefixes and suffixes to
  call numbers based on their shelving location, the functionality was limited
  primarily to printing spine labels.  As of 2.1, you also have the option to
  assign prefixes or suffixes for individual call numbers; these will be
  displayed in the public catalogue and other interfaces, but prefixes in
  particular do not affect shelf browsing, which is based entirely on the
  label.
* Bibliographic parts: This feature adds the ability to designate specific
  "part" roles for the items attached to a given bibliographic record, such
  that a user can place holds on a specific kind of item without limiting it
  to an individual item. For example, libraries may assign parts to each DVD
  in a season of a popular TV show; or to individual volumes of an
  encyclopedia. This feature also introduces "part holds".
* Conjoined items: This feature adds the ability to associate a single barcode
  with multiple bibliographic records, so that the availability of those
  records is updated based on that copy. For example, libraries may make an
  electronic reader available for loan that is preloaded with 1000 electronic
  books; they can add 1000 bibliographic records to the library system and
  associate them all with a single barcode, so that when the electronic reader
  is signed out, the availability for all 1000 records changes to "Checked out".

Circulation improvements:
-------------------------
* Transfer selected holds to a different title: It is now possible to select
  multiple holds on a given title and transfer them to a different title.
  USE CASE?
* Mark patron as exempt from collections: It is now possible to mark a patron
  as being exempt from being sent to collections.

Public interface improvements:
------------------------------
* Spell-checking suggestions are now case-insensitive, to avoid generating
  terms which would yield the same result set.
* Part holds: patrons are guided to select a specific part if they are
  placing a hold on a bibliographic record that has parts assigned to its
  copies.
* Located URI visibility: Located URIs (856 fields with a subfield $9
  specifying the shortname of the owning library) now show up in a search with
  a context library of its owning library or below. For example, a Located URI
  with an owner of SYS1 WILL cause its record to show up in a search with a
  context OU of BR1 or SYS1, regardless of depth scoping.
* Set a JavaScript cache token when `autogen.sh` is run, so that a subsequent
  run of `autogen.sh` will automatically cause browsers to fetch refreshed
  copies of generated files.
